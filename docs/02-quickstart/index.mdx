#### Step 3: Enable CORS [Optional]

If you are developing a frontend application and want to get started quickly
with the API, you can create an API key with CORS access enabled. API keys
created with this option can be used from the browser from any origin for which
it is configured.

#### Step 4: Click `Create`.

> **Note:** Livepeer Studio currently allows you to reveal the secret of any
> existing API key. However, this behavior may change in the future. **Make sure
> to persist the API key safely.** You will always be able to delete an API key
> and create a new one as necessary.

#### Usage

To use an API key, you can simply add an `Authorization` header to your request
with the`Bearer` scheme and the API key as the value.

**For example:**

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
  https://livepeer.studio/api/user/me
```

With this, you're ready to start building!
