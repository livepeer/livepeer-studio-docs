## Steps to get started with Livepeer Studio

> This guide assumes you already have a Livepeer Studio account and access to
> our Dashboard.

1. 🔑 [Create a Livepeer Studio API key](#create-api-key)
2. 🤝 [Set up Livepeer as your client](#set-livepeer-client)
3. 💻 [Start building!](#start-building)

### 1. Create a Livepeer Studio API key {#create-api-key}

#### Step 1: Click `Create API Key`. A dialogue should appear.

#### Step 2: In the dialogue field, enter a name for your API key.

#### Step 3: Enable CORS [Optional]

If you are developing a frontend application and want to get started quickly
with the API, you can create an API key with CORS access enabled. API keys
created with this option can be used from the browser from any origin for which
it is configured.

#### Step 4: Click `Create`.

> **Note:** Livepeer Studio currently allows you to reveal the secret of any
> existing API key. However, this behavior may change in the future. **Make sure
> to persist the API key safely.**

> You will always be able to delete an API key and create a new one as
> necessary.

#### Usage

To use an API key, you can simply add an `Authorization` header to your request
with the`Bearer` scheme and the API key as the value.

**For example:**

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
  https://livepeer.studio/api/user/me
```

### 2. Set up Livepeer as your client {#set-livepeer-client}

Want to integrate Livepeer into your production app?

#### livepeer.js SDK

livepeer.js makes building with Livepeer effortless. It provides a core vanilla JS 
library to easily connect to a Livepeer provider (e.g. Livepeer Studio), as well as 
React-specific hooks with a similar API to provide memoization and DOM management.

#### Step 1: Install the livepeer.js SDK

To install the livepeer.js SDK, you want to create a project, and then navigate to your 
project directory to run the installation. Let's go ahead and do that! Once we're in 
our home directory, let's execute the following:

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
mkdir your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npm init   # (or npm init --yes)
npm install livepeer @livepeer/react wagmi ethers
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
mkdir your-project-name
cd your-project-name
yarn init # (or yarn init --yes)
yarn add livepeer @livepeer/react wagmi ethers
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

#### Step 2: Create your livepeer client

Declare and configure the client with Livepeer Studio using `studioProvider`. 

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="app.js" label="app.js">

```js
import { createReactClient } from '@livepeer/react';
import { studioProvider } from 'livepeer/providers/studio';
 
const client = createReactClient({
  provider: studioProvider({ apiKey: `${process.env.API_TOKEN}` }),
});

function App() {
  return (
    <LivepeerConfig client={client}>
      <Livepeer />
    </LivepeerConfig>
  );
}
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>
