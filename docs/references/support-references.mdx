The following descriptions include support information and instructions for common FAQs for Livepeer Studio.

## Custom Domain

The following provides information on how to use a custom domain for livestreaming with Livepeer Studio:

- Livepeer Studio Ingest URL
- Name your URL
- Configure your URL

## Debugging livestream issues

You can follow these steps to [debug common stream playback issues](https://livepeer.studio/preview/blog/debugging-playback-issues).

1. Log into the Livepeer Studio dashboard the [Livepeer Studio test player](https://livepeer.studio/app/test-player)

1. Locate your playback URL. **_See_** [The Livestream Guide](/guides/livestreaming/playback) for detailed information on finding your live stream playback URL.

## Disconnects

Sometimes, after connecting to an encoder (for example, OBS) and Livepeer Studio RTMP server, the connection drops. For example, this could happen because of a bug in the encoder software or a problem with the streamer’s internet connection.

Livepeer Studio has a built-in 5 minute reconnect window, which means that if the streamer’s encoder disconnects and then reconnects within 5 minutes, the session will resume. Additionally, if you are using Livepeer Studio recording feature, the recorded session will not be split into two separate sessions.

### Reconnect Window Customization

The reconnect window is currently not customizable.

## Livepeer Ingest URL

The Livepeer Studio.com global-optimized ingest URL:

`rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live/{stream-key}`

### Naming Your URL

You can `CNAME` `rtmp.livepeer.studio` to customize that URL to something with your brand, e.g. `rtmp.companyname.io`.

### Configuring Your URL

You can configure this with your DNS provider.

## Reducing Latency

Livepeer Studio routes your livestreams to the nearest available datacenter to ensure your streamers and live stream viewers have a consistent, high quality experience with the minimum latency Livepeer Studio can provide.

### Optimized URLs

These globally-optimized URLs are the best option for nearly all those working with Livepeer Studio.

- Stream into: `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream-key}`
- Playback from: `https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`

If you created your stream via the API, confirm your profile bitrate settings are [reasonable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/hls_authoring_specification_for_apple_devices).

If the source stream is causing poor playback performance even though you are using the globally-optimized URLs above and good bitrate settings. The source stream is the stream sent from your broadcast software. Livepeer Studio serves the source stream with the transcoded renditions via the playback URL.

### Testing latency

If the source stream is causing poor playback performance even though you are using the globally-optimized URLs above and good bitrate settings. The source stream is the stream sent from your broadcast software. Livepeer Studio serves the source stream with the transcoded renditions via the playback URL.

1. Check the Session Ingest Rate graph at the bottom of the page. If the chart shows a lot of sharp peaks and valleys, this indicates your broadcasting workflow is unstable. The RTMP stream hitting the Livepeer Studio ingest server has problems. Try ensuring a stronger internet connection at the source via a wired ethernet connection or by broadcasting on a more reliable network.
   One way to test if the source stream is causing problems is by inputting the playback URL in the [Test Player](https://livepeer.studio/app/test-player). The Test Player is only available to logged in users.

1. Check the Session Ingest Rate graph at the bottom of the page. If the chart shows a lot of sharp peaks and valleys, this indicates your broadcasting workflow is unstable. The RTMP stream hitting the Livepeer Studio ingest server has problems. Try ensuring a stronger internet connection at the source via a wired ethernet connection or by broadcasting on a more reliable network.

1. Check the left player, which shows your source stream, as served by the Livepeer Studio CDN. This player is configured to only playback the highest resolution available. On rare occasions, the highest resolution is the non-transcoded source stream.

1. Compare the source in the left player with the transcoded renditions in the player on the right (ABR). You can manually switch between transcoded renditions by clicking on the `⋮` symbol in the lower right corner of the player.

1. If the problems in the source-only stream are also present in the transcoded renditions, there is something wrong with your source stream.

- If you are able, instruct the streamer to set the keyframe interval to 2 in their broadcasting software; this can help.

- In general, make sure your broadcasting workflow is stable. If the RTMP stream hitting the Livepeer Studio ingest server has problems, try ensuring a stronger internet connection at the source via a wired ethernet connection or by broadcasting on a more reliable network.

## Paywall for Your Livestreams

Building paywall is a common approach form monetizing live video \*\*content. Livepeer Studio does not have a built-in paywall feature. However, it integrates well with other tools and platforms.

### Example Paywall Solutions

- [JWPlayer](https://www.jwplayer.com/) allows you to create a password for each video asset, or to lock down access to public video altogether via URL token signing. Refer to the [JWPlayer Livepeer Studio demo app](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-jwplayer-demo) for an example integration between JWPlayer and Livepeer Studio.
- For WordPress sites, there is a [rich plugin ecosystem](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/paywall/) that provide many different paywall options.
- You can use application logic to hide the unique Livepeer Studio video playback URL behind a custom paywall by default.

## SRT Support

SRT ingest is supported for all users and is currently in Beta. To stream in SRT, change your stream URL to:

`srt://rtmp.livepeer.studio:2935?streamid={stream-key}`

The SRT ingest URL is also included in the Dashboard, making it easy to copy and paste. It can be found below the RTMP ingest URL on the Stream Detail page.

There is no need to use a stream key when using the SRT ingest URL, as the stream key is already included.

Please ensure that your encoder is compatible with SRT. Streaming with SRT is compatible with OBS but may not be compatible with all encoders.

## Stream Delivery via CDN

Streams delivered via content delivery network (CDN) are handled according to your plan:

### Payback for all Pro plan streams

Payback for all Pro plan streams is delivered via a content delivery network (CDN). The transcoded video stream automatically switches between the transcoded renditions based on the viewers’ available bandwidth, device performance, and network conditions.

### Non-CDN delivery

**Non-CDN delivery** for free tier users is limited to 10 viewers per account.

## Usage and Billing

Usage for the current billing cycle is displayed on the Home page,[livepeer.studio/dashboard](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard) when you login to the Livepeer Studio Dashboard.
