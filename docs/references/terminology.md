| **API**                             | Refers to the Livepeer Studio API ("the API")                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ABR                                 | An Internet Video Streaming industry standard term, ABR streaming is known as "Adaptive Bitrate Streaming". The Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) ladder can be considered metaphorically and refers to "the array of segments of different quality and resolution which are available from the streaming server. If the bitrate rises, the logic in a video player can select a larger size file with better quality to play, thus resembling the "climbing up of the ladder". |
| Audio                               | Livepeer Studio has the capability for playing back audio separately from video (with the proper format for transcoding). For example, if you want to playback Audio only streams, once you upload a video with audio, you can turn the video off.<br />See [Audio Only Streams](/guides/livestreaming/playback#audio-only-streams).                                                                                                                                 |
| CDN                                 | [Stream deliver via CDN](/core-concepts/cdn)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Container                           | A package/wrapper for the media essence, a file format. When files are uploaded they are uploaded with audio and vidio in a "Container" or "Manifest"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| WebRTC                              | Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) is a set of browser APIs compatible with secure RTP (SRTP).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                                     | **Advantage:** It has all the properties of RTSP with the added bonus of browser compatibility. **Disadvantage:** It is still relatively new and has not seen much use yet, but promises to be the most prevalent protocol in the near future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
