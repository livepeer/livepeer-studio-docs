title: Back up transcoding
---

Livepeer Studio routes your live streams to the nearest available Livepeer node
to ensure your streamers and live stream viewers have a consistent, high quality
experience with the minimum latency Livepeer Studio can provide.

These globally-optimized URLs are the best option for nearly all Livepeer Studio
users.

- Stream into: `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live/[stream-key]`
- Playback from: `https://livepeercdn.com/hls/[playbackId]/index.m3u8`

## Back-up transcoding with regional ingest and playback URLs

To leverage back-up transcoding, you must create two streams, each with a unique
`streamKey.` Then, instead of streaming into the global ingest URL above, you'll
point one stream towards a specific region's ingest data center and the other
stream towards a different region's ingest data center.

While more control can be helpful, there are downsides to forgoing the global
ingest and playback URLs and selecting a regional URL pair.

- **Increased latency**: If you stream into a regional ingest URL, Livepeer
  Studio routes the stream to that region's data center for ingest. Playback
  also originates in that data center. Suppose the live streamer is far away
  from that data center region. In that case, this will introduce latency that
  could have been avoided if they streamed into the global ingest URL,
  `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live/`. Additionally, distant live stream viewers
  will have a more latent experience than if the stream was ingested via the
  global URL.
- **Riskier during unforeseen outages**: On the rare occasion that a Livepeer
  Studio ingests data center goes entirely offline. All active live streams into
  that data center region will need to restart their streams using a different
  regional ingest URL ... and send all their livestream viewers a different
  regional playback URL. This could be a bad user experience for your stream
  viewers. the stream was ingested via the global ingest URL,
  `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live/`, the playback URL would stay the same even
  if the livestream had to reconnect.

If you opt out of the global, ingest and playback URLs and use regional. URL
pairs, here's what you need to know.

1. You can not use the same stream key to connect to multiple regional ingest
   URLs simultaneously. For simultaneous back-up stream transcoding, create
   multiple unique stream keys.
2. Stream into: `rtmp://[region]-rtmp.livepeer.studio/live/[stream-key]`.
3. Playback from:
   `https://[region]-cdn.livepeer.studio/hls/[playbackId]/index.m3u8`.

An RTMP ingest and playback URL pair API hardware in different parts of the
world. Each region is three letters, the airport code of the server location.
Use the ingest and playback URL pair in the area closest to your broadcaster.
For any stream session, you must **use the RTMP ingest URL and playback URL pair
from the same place.**

#### Request

Find the closest ingest data center

```bash
curl "https://livepeer.studio/api/ingest"
```

#### Response

Returns the ingest data center region

- 200 OK
- Content-Type: application/json

```bash
[
  {
    ingest: "rtmp://{nearbyRegion}-rtmp.livepeer.studio/live",
    playback: "https://{nearbyRegion}-cdn.livepeer.studio/hls"
  }
];
```

#### Request

You will sometimes want to use a base URL pair of a region different from the
one closest to you. You can get a list of all base URL pairs by calling
`https://livepeer.studio/api/ingest?first=false`.

```bash
curl "https://livepeer.studio/api/ingest?first=false"
```

#### Response

Return a list of all regional base URL pairs

- 200 OK
- `Content-Type: application/json`

```bash
[
   {
      "ingest":"rtmp://{region-1}-rtmp.livepeer.studio/live",
      "playback":"https://{region-1}-cdn.livepeer.studio/hls",
      "base":"https://{region-1}-cdn.livepeer.studio"
   },
   {
      "ingest":"rtmp://{region-2}-rtmp.livepeer.studio/live",
      "playback":"https://{region-2}-cdn.livepeer.studio/hls",
      "base":"https://{region-2}-cdn.livepeer.studio"
   },
   {
      "ingest":"rtmp://{region-3}-rtmp.livepeer.studio/live",
      "playback":"https://{region-3}-cdn.livepeer.studio/hls",
      "base":"https://{region-3}-cdn.livepeer.studio"
   }
]
