title: Create a livestream

This guide provides instructions and information about creating a livestream:

- Understanding the `stream` object
- Ways to create a stream object
- Working with example API requests
- No-code stream creation (optional)

## About the `stream` Object

**It is important to note,** that the`stream` object is the core building block
of the Livepeer Studio platform.

In Livepeer Studio, the`stream` object has unique configuration data and
metadata about all livestream sessions that are associated with the stream.

> **Note:** historically, a `stream` object with a `parentId`represented a
> single livestream session. This type of "child-session" stream object will be
> deprecated in an upcoming version of the API in favor of the `session` object.

## What You Can Build Here

| Implementation                          | Description                             |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Create a stream for livestreaming       | Broadcast livestreams of any duration   |
| Create a stream to broadcast recordings | Broadcast 24/7 livestream of recordings |

## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you can set up your environment to prepare for
developing your application:

- Sign up for a free Livepeer Studio account
- Get an API key
- Access the [API Reference](/reference/api/create-stream/)

## Ways to Create a Stream Object

There are two ways to create a stream object:

- Via the API
- Via the dashboard (no code)

## Create a stream object with a POST request to the API

Send a `POST` request to `https://livepeer.studio/api/stream`. This creates a
new Livepeer Studio `stream` object.

Use a Livepeer Studio API key as a part of the authorization header, and use a
JSON body to specify the configuration for the stream. The only parameter you
are required to set is the `name` of your stream.

If you do not define transcoding rendition `profiles` when creating the
`stream`, a default set of profiles will be used with 720p, 480p, 360p and 240p
renditions. To disable transcoding for your stream you have to explicitly set an
empty array of `profiles` in your stream object. Beware that in that setup, your
playback video will have the attributes of the source stream only and will not
take advantage of adaptive bitrate streaming, likely buffering on playback.

### Request

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
-d '{
  "name": "test_stream",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "720p",
      "bitrate": 2000000,
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 720
    },
    {
      "name": "480p",
      "bitrate": 1000000,
      "width": 854,
      "height": 480
    },
    {
      "name": "360p",
      "bitrate": 500000,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 360
    }
  ]
}' \
https://livepeer.studio/api/stream
```

### Response

This is an example response to the request above. `streamKey`, `playbackId`, and
`id` are unique to the `stream` object. You will need the `streamKey` to
broadcast live video and the `playbackId` to configure the playback URL to watch
the live stream.

```json
{
    "name":"test_stream",
    "profiles":[
        {"name":"720p","bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"width":1280,"height":720},
        {"name":"480p","bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"width":854,"height":480},
        {"name":"360p","bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"width":640,"height":360},
      ],
    "id":"ijkl61f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a",
    "createdAt":1596081229373,
    "streamKey":"abcd-uimq-jtgy-x98v",
    "playbackId":"efghb2mxupongp5k",
    {other asset object keys}
}
```

## No-code stream creation with the Livepeer Studio Dashboard

1. Log in to the Livepeer Studio Dashboard
1. Navigate to the Streams page,
   [livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams).
   On this page, you can create a new stream and delete streams. When you name
   your stream, pick a unique name and include URL-compatible characters only.
1. On the Stream page
   ([livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams)),
   you can also click on a stream to find out configuration and usage
   information.
