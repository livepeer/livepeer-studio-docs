The viewership API is still in development. Currently, viewer count metrics are
only available for on demand assets. The count registers start views with
deduping logic that prevents users from attempting to inflate view counts. In
the future, we'll support additional viewership and engagement metrics so you
can better understand popularity and performance.
[Let us know](https://livepeer.studio/contact) if you have any particular
feature requests related to metrics.

:::

## Step 1: Register views

To collect and register viewership metrics, you need to configure your player.
Currently the viewership data is only registered if you're using the
[Livepeer player](https://livepeerjs.org/react/Player). It also comes fully
configured for the best playback experience with Livepeer, so it's the
recommended way to get started. You can follow
[this guide](/guides/playback-a-video-stream) to setup the Livepeer player.

We are currently working on support for viewership data using custom players as
well. If you need any urgent help with this
[get in touch](https://livepeer.studio/contact) and we may be able to assist
you.

## Step 1: Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset

Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset. An `asset.id` can be found in the
response object of any API call working with assets. If you haven't created an
asset yet, you can follow the
[upload a video asset guide](/guides/on-demand/upload-video-asset#api) to do so.

## Step 2: Retrieve viewership data

Once you have the `asset.id`, you can make a request to get the viewership data.
