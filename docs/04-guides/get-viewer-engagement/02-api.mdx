:::note

The viewership API is still in development. Currently, viewer count metrics are
only available for on demand assets. The count registers start views with
deduping logic that prevents users from attempting to inflate view counts. In
the future, we'll support additional viewership and engagement metrics so you
can better understand popularity and performance.
[Let us know](https://livepeer.studio/contact) if you have any particular
feature requests related to metrics.

:::

## Step 1: Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset

Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset. An `asset.id` can be found in the
response object of any API call working with assets. If you haven't created an
asset yet, you can follow the
[upload a video asset guide](/guides/on-demand/upload-video-asset#api) to do so.

## Step 2: Retrieve viewership data

Once you have the `asset.id`, you can make a request to get the viewership data.
