# Get viewer engagement

This guide provides information about registering and retrieving views from a
video using the [dashboard](./dashboard) or the [Livepeer player API](./api).

## Register views

To collect and register viewership metrics, you need to configure your player.
Currently the viewership data is only registered if you're using the
[Livepeer player](https://livepeerjs.org/). It also comes fully configured for
the best playback experience with Livepeer, so it's the recommended way to get
started. You can follow [this guide](/guides/playback-a-video-stream) to setup
the Livepeer player.

We are currently working on support for viewership data using custom players as
well. If you need any urgent help with this
[get in touch](https://livepeer.studio/contact) and we may be able to assist
you.

## Retrieve viewership metrics

### Caveats

The viewership API is still in development. Currently, we only support unique start
views, views when a unique viewer opens or start watching an asset. In the future, we'll
support additional viewership and engagement metrics so you can understand your
user's experience.
