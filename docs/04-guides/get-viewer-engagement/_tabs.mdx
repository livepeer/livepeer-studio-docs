# Get viewer engagement

This guide provides information about registering and retrieving views from a
video using the [dashboard](./dashboard) or the [Livepeer API](./api).

## Register views

To collect and register viewership metrics, you need to configure your player.
Currently the viewership data is only registered if you're using the
[Livepeer player](https://livepeerjs.org/react/Player). It also comes fully configured for
the best playback experience with Livepeer, so it's the recommended way to get
started. You can follow [this guide](/guides/playback-a-video-stream) to setup
the Livepeer player.

We are currently working on support for viewership data using custom players as
well. If you need any urgent help with this
[get in touch](https://livepeer.studio/contact) and we may be able to assist
you.

## Retrieve viewership metrics

### Caveats

The viewership API is still in development. Currently, viewer count metrics are only available for On Demand assets. The count registers start views with some deduping logic that prevents users from attempting to inflate view counts. In the future, we'll
support additional viewership and engagement metrics so you can better understand popularity and performance. [Let us know](https://livepeer.studio/contact) if you have any particular feature requests related to metrics.
