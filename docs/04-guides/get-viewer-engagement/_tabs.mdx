# Get viewer engagement

This guide provides information about registering and retrieving views from a video using
the [dashboard](./dashboard) or the [Livepeer player API](./api).

## Register views

To display viewership data, you need to configure your player first.
We recommend using the [Livepeer player](https://livepeerjs.org/) as the player
is already configured. You can follow this [guide](guides/playback-a-video-stream) to
setup the Livepeer player.

## Caveats

The viewership API is still in development. Currently, we only support start views,
views when you open or start watching an asset. In the future, we will be supporting
end views and total views.
