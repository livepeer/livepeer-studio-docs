# Get viewer engagement

This guide provides information about adding and retrieving viewership to a video using
the [dashboard](./dashboard) or the [Livepeer player API](./api).

## Caveats

The viewership API is still in development. Currently, we only support start views,
views when you open or start watching an asset. In the future, we'll support additional viewership and engagement metrics so you can understand your user's experience.
