# Playback a video

This guide provides you the instructions to playback a video or a live stream on
your website/applications. To playback live streams or on-demand video inside
your application, you'll need to use a video player component that supports the
HLS protocol.

You can either use Livepeer's built-in player or your own player. This guide
covers both options.

## Using Livepeer's player

[Livepeer.js](https://livepeerjs.org/) is a JavaScript library that allows you
to upload, retrieve, and play assets. It provides a core vanilla JS library to
easily connect to a Livepeer provider (e.g. Livepeer Studio), as well as
React-specific hooks/components to provide memoization and DOM management.

:::note

Livepeer.js currently only supports applications built with React.js and
Next.js.

### Get video playback id

Each video or live stream has a unique playback id. You can get the playback id
from the response of the [Create a video](/reference/api/create-asset-with-url)
or [Create a livestream](/reference/api/create-stream) API.

The response should look like this:

```js
{
    "asset": {
        "id": "7d042176-230b-464c-a677-4a19b513193c",
        // highlight-start
        "playbackId": "7d048tbcfrv6gvzs",
        // highlight-end
        "userId": "80dc8f6e-69d5-401f-bbd7-bfc09a2a5320",
        "createdAt": 1659715086322,
        "status": {
            "phase": "waiting",
            "updatedAt": 1659715086322
        },
        "name": "Example name"
    },
    "task": {
        "id": "d3a2ab1b-8dd1-450d-ac8e-498fd9d91865"
    }
}
```

### Installation

Once you have the playback id, the next step is to install the library. You can
do so by running the following command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">npm install @livepeer/react</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">yarn add @livepeer/react</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Usage

The Player component provides an easy way to display video or audio. You can
also [customize](https://livepeerjs.org/react/Player) the player's theme and
controls.

```jsx
import { Player } from "@livepeer/react";

export const SimplePlayer = () => {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      showPipButton
    />
  );
};
```

<LivepeerPlayer />

## Using your own player

Using livepeer.js is the easiest and recommended way to playback a video or a
live stream. However, if you want to use your own player, you can do so by
following the instructions below.

Please note that to playback live streams inside your application you'll need to
use a video player component that supports the HLS.

### Create a playback URL

To playback a live stream in other players, you'll need to create an HLS URL.
HLS is a protocol that allows you to stream video and audio content over HTTP.
Most of the video you watch on the web is delivered using HLS. Livepeer also
uses HLS to deliver video and audio content.

:::caution

Playback URLs are different for live streams and on-demand videos. Please make
sure you're using the correct URL for the type of content you're trying to
playback.

:::

You can create an HLS url by using the below format and replacing the
`PLAYBACK_ID` with your stream's playback id.

```txt
https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{PLAYBACK_ID}/index.m3u8
```

On-demand videos have a different format for the playback URLs. To playback such
videos, you can use the below format and replace the `PLAYBACK_ID` with your
video's playback id.

```txt
https://livepeercdn.com/asset/{PLAYBACK_ID}/video
```

### Use the playback URL in a player

You can use the playback URL is any video player that supports HLS. Here is a
list of popular players that supports HLS:

- [Video.js](https://videojs.com/)
- [Plyr.io](https://plyr.io/)
- [HLS.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js)
- [JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com/html5-video-player/)
- [Bitmovin Player](https://bitmovin.com/video-player/)

Here is an example of how to use the playback URL in video.js player.

```html
<head>
  <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet" />

  <!-- If you'd like to support IE8 (for Video.js versions prior to v7) -->
  <!-- <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/ie8/1.1.2/videojs-ie8.min.js"></script> -->
</head>

<body>
  <video
    id="my-video"
    class="video-js"
    controls
    preload="auto"
    width="640"
    height="264"
    poster="MY_VIDEO_POSTER.jpg">
    <source
      src="https://livepeercdn.com/asset/${PLAYBACK_ID}/video"
      type="video/mp4" />
  </video>

  <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script>
</body>
```

<VideoJSPlayer />

## Embeddable Player

:::caution

The embeddable player is currently in beta and some elements may change as we
mature the product. For a production-grade application consider using
Livepeer.js instead.

:::

This is one of the easiest way to playback a video on your website/applications.
You can embed the player on your website/applications by using the below code
snippet.

You can replace the `PLAYBACK_ID` with your video's playback id.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://lvpr.tv?v={PLAYBACK_ID}"
  frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen
  allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture"
  sandbox="allow-scripts">
</iframe>
```

<IframePlayer />
