# Playback a video

This guide provides you the instructions to playback a video or a live stream on
your website/applications. To playback live streams or on-demand video inside
your application, you'll need to use a video player component that supports the
HLS protocol.

You can either use Livepeer's built-in player or your own player. This guide
covers both options.

## Using Livepeer's player

Livepeer.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to upload, retrieve, and
play assets. It provides a core vanilla JS library to easily connect to a
Livepeer provider (e.g. Livepeer Studio), as well as React-specific
hooks/components to provide memoization and DOM management.

:::note

Livepeer.js currently only supports applications built with React.js and
Next.js.

### Get video playback id

Each video or live stream has a unique playback id. You can get the playback id
from the response of the [Create a video](/reference/api/create-asset-with-url)
or [Create a livestream](/reference/api/create-stream) API.

The response should look like this:

```js
{
    "asset": {
        "id": "7d042176-230b-464c-a677-4a19b513193c",
        // highlight-start
        "playbackId": "7d048tbcfrv6gvzs",
        // highlight-end
        "userId": "80dc8f6e-69d5-401f-bbd7-bfc09a2a5320",
        "createdAt": 1659715086322,
        "status": {
            "phase": "waiting",
            "updatedAt": 1659715086322
        },
        "name": "Example name"
    },
    "task": {
        "id": "d3a2ab1b-8dd1-450d-ac8e-498fd9d91865"
    }
}
```

### Installation

Once you have the playback id, the next step is to install the library. You can
do so by running the following command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">npm install @livepeer/react</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">yarn add @livepeer/react</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Usage

The Player component provides an easy way to display video or audio. You can
also customize the player's theme and controls.

```jsx
import { Player } from "@livepeer/react";

export const SimplePlayer = () => {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Agent 327: Operation Barbershop"
      playbackId="6d7el73r1y12chxr"
      showPipButton
    />
  );
};
```

<Player />

## Using your own player

Using livepeer.js is the easiest and recommended way to playback a video or a
live stream. However, if you want to use your own player, you can do so by
following the instructions below.

:::caution

Please note that to playback live streams inside your application you'll need to
use a video player component that supports the HLS.

:::

### Create a playback URL

To playback a live stream in other players, you'll need to create an HLS URL.
HLS is a protocol that allows you to stream video and audio content over HTTP.
Most of the video you watch on the web is delivered using HLS. Livepeer also
uses HLS to deliver video and audio content.

You can create a HLS url by using the below format and replacing the
`PLAYBACK_ID` with your stream's playback id.

```txt
https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{PLAYBACK_ID}/index.m3u8
```

However, if you want to playback a video that is already uploaded to Livepeer,
you can use the below format and replace the `PLAYBACK_ID` with your video's
playback id.

```txt
https://livepeercdn.com/asset/{PLAYBACK_ID}/video
```

### Use the playback URL in a player

You can use the playback URL is any video player that supports HLS. Here is a
list of popular players that supports HLS:

- [Video.js](https://videojs.com/)
- [Plyr.io](https://plyr.io/)
- [HLS.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js)
- [JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com/html5-video-player/)
- [Bitmovin Player](https://bitmovin.com/video-player/)

Here is an example of how to use the playback URL in a `video` tag.

```jsx
import React from "react";

export default function Player() {
  return (
    <div>
      <video
        controls
        src="https://livepeercdn.com/asset/6d7el73r1y12chxr/video"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
