# Playback a video

To playback your live or on demand video inside your application you'll need to
use a video player component that supports the HLS protocol. While there are
many HLS video players out there, we recommend using
[livepeer.js](https://livepeerjs.org).

## Audio-only streams

If you want to provide only the audio version of the stream, you can use
?video=false at the end of an .m3u8 URL to get an audio-only stream. For
example, `https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8?video=none`
