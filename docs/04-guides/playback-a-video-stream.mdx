# Playback a video

To playback your live or on demand video inside your application you'll need to
use a video player component that supports the HLS protocol. 

HLS is a standard protocol for streaming video over the internet. Most of the videos 
you watch on the internet, both live video and on-demand video is delivered over HLS. 
Livepeer delivers your videos in this standard format.

While there are many HLS video players out there, we recommend using [livepeer.js](https://livepeerjs.org).

## Step 1: Get the `playbackId`

Get the `playbackId` of an existing asset. The `playbackId` can be found in the
response object of any API call working with assets. If you haven't created an
asset yet, you can follow the
[upload a video asset guide](/guides/on-demand/upload-video-asset#api) to do so.

## Step 2: Use the `playbackId` in a player

Once we have the `playbackId` we can use it in a player. We recommend using [livepeer.js](https://livepeerjs.org)
but any HLS video player will work.

<CodeBlockTabItem value="livepeer.js" label="livepeer.js">

```js
import { Player } from '@livepeer/react';
 
function App() {
  return (
    <Player
      title="Example Video"
      playbackId={playbackId}
    />
  );
}
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <video width="500px" controls>
        <source src={`https://livepeercdn.com/asset/${playbackId}/video`} type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
  );
}
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>


## Audio-only streams

If you want to provide only the audio version of the stream, you can use
?video=false at the end of an .m3u8 URL to get an audio-only stream. For
example, `https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8?video=none`
