The Livepeer API allows you to send video files to Livepeer and get them ready
for optimized playback. Videos can be provided either by you (static content) or
your users, given your application offers an interface for them to do so.

You can upload video assets [via a url](#uploading-via-url), a
[direct upload](#direct-upload) or a [resumable upload](#resumable-upload).

## Caveats

- Files are currently limited to 1GB in size. Any files greater than that will
  likely error out during the upload or processing steps.
- Only MP4 files encoded with H.264 and AAC are supported

## Uploading via URL

When using the upload via URL method:

- Provide the name of the asset
- Provide the URL of the asset that should be imported

### Step 1: Upload asset by URL

To upload the asset to the Livepeer network, you'll need to make a POST request
and include the URL of the asset to be uploaded.

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
const uploadAssetURL = await fetch("https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/import", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        url: "$EXTERNAL_URL"
        name: "Example name",
    }),
});
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/import' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "url":"$EXTERNAL_URL",
    "name":"Example name"
}'
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Step 2: Check the upload status

After uploading your asset, get the `asset.id` from the
[response object](/reference/api/create-asset-with-url#response) of the POST
request. The `asset.id` represents the status of your upload.

When `asset.status: "ready"` is returned in the response, the asset has finished
uploading and will be ready for playback. If `asset.status: "waiting"` is
returned in the response, the asset is not available yet and you should make the
API call again until `asset.status: "ready"`.

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
const response = await fetch("https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id}", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});

const { status } = response.json();
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN'
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Direct Upload

A direct upload uploads the whole video asset in one HTTP request, as opposed to
the [resumable upload protocol](#resumable-upload), which uploads the video
asset in multiple requests. Doing a direct upload reduces the number of HTTP
requests but increases the chance of failures (such as connection failures) that
can happen with large uploads.

### Step 1: Generate upload URL

To upload the asset to the Livepeer network locally, you'll need to make a POST
request to generate an upload URL.

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
const response = await fetch(
  "https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/request-upload",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: "Example name",
    }),
  }
);

const { url } = await response.json();
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/request-upload' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name":"Example name"
}'
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Step 2: Upload your video to the URL

Using the URL generated in the response, upload your video with a PUT request.

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
await fetch(url, {
  method: "PUT",
  body: fs.createReadStream(path),
});
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl --location --request PUT "${url}" \
--data-binary '@$VIDEO_FILE_PATH'
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Step 3: Check the upload status

After uploading your asset, get the `asset.id` from the
[response object](/reference/api/create-asset-with-url#response) of the POST
request. The `asset.id` represents the status of your upload.

When `asset.status: "ready"` is returned in the response, the asset has finished
uploading and will be ready for playback. If `asset.status: "waiting"` is
returned in the response, the asset is not available yet and you should make the
API call again until `asset.status: "ready"`.

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
const response = await fetch("https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id}", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LP_API_KEY}`,
  },
});

const { status } = response.json();
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN'
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Resumable Upload

A resumable upload allows you to resume an upload operation after a
communication failure interrupts the flow of data. Because you don't have to
restart large file uploads from the start, resumable uploads can also reduce
your bandwidth usage if there is a network failure.

Resumable uploads are useful when your file sizes might vary greatly or when
there is a fixed time limit for requests. You might also use resumable uploads
for situations where you want to show an upload progress bar.

### Step 1: Generate upload URL

To upload the asset to the Livepeer network locally, you'll need to make a POST
request to generate an upload URL.

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
const response = await fetch(
  "https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/request-upload",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: "Example name",
    }),
  }
);

const { tusEndpoint } = await response.json();
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/request-upload' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name":"Example name"
}'
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Step 2: Upload your resumable video via Tus

Livepeer Studio supports resumable uploads via [Tus](https://tus.io/). This
section provides a simple example of how to use `tus-js-client` to upload a
video file.

You should use the `tusEndpoint` field of the
[response object](/reference/api/create-asset#response-example) to upload the
video file and track the progress:

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
//  This assumes there is an `input` element of `type="file"` with id `fileInput` in the HTML
const input = document.getElementById("fileInput");
const file = input.files[0];
const upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
  endpoint: tusEndpoint, // URL from `tusEndpoint` field in the `/request-upload` response
  metadata: {
    filename,
    filetype: "video/mp4",
  },
  uploadSize: file.size,
  onError(err) {
    console.error("Error uploading file:", err);
  },
  onProgress(bytesUploaded, bytesTotal) {
    const percentage = ((bytesUploaded / bytesTotal) * 100).toFixed(2);
    console.log("Uploaded " + percentage + "%");
  },
  onSuccess() {
    console.log("Upload finished:", upload.url);
  },
});
const previousUploads = await upload.findPreviousUploads();
if (previousUploads.length > 0) {
  upload.resumeFromPreviousUpload(previousUploads[0]);
}
upload.start();
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

> **Note:** If you are using `tus` from `node.js`, you need to add a custom URL
> storage to enable resuming from previous uploads. On the browser, this is
> enabled by default using local storage. In `node.js`, add
> `urlStorage: new tus.FileUrlStorage("path/to/tmp/file")`, to the `UploadFile`
> object definition above.
