# Store Video Asset on IPFS

This guide provides you the instructions to store a video asset on IPFS from the [Livepeer Studio Dashboard](./dashboard) 
or through the [Livepeer API](./api).

## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you will need to meet the following dependencies for 
working with the On Demand feature:

- [A Livepeer Studio account](https://livepeer.studio/login)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Access to the [API Reference](https://docs.livepeer.studio/references)
- An [API Key](https://docs.livepeer.studio/guides/livestreaming/api-key) to call the VOD API
    - Note: Calling the API from the frontend requires an API key with CORS access allowed

Throughout this guide you'll see a few terms mentioned multiple times, asset and task:
- **Asset**: an object that represents a file
- **Task**: an action taken on the file
