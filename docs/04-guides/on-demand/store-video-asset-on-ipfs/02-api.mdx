The Video-on-Demand (VOD) API allows you to send video files to Livepeer and get them 
ready for optimized playback. Those videos can be provided either by you (static content) 
or your users, given your application offers an interface for them to do so.

## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you will need to meet the following dependencies for
working with the On Demand feature:

- [A Livepeer Studio account](https://livepeer.studio/login)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Access to the [API Reference](https://docs.livepeer.studio/references)
- An [API Key](https://docs.livepeer.studio/guides/livestreaming/api-key) to
  call the VOD API
  - Note: Calling the API from the frontend requires an API key with CORS access
    allowed

## Caveats

- Currently assets cannot be deleted from the default Livepeer Studio storage. 
You can customize any additional storage though.
- Only IPFS is supported as an additional storge at the moment. We are currently 
working on support for other decentralized storages like Arweave and Storj.

## Step 1: Get the $ASSET_ID of an existing asset
Get the $ASSET_ID of an existing asset by making a request to list all existing assets in your account.
If you haven't created an asset yet, you can follow the [upload a video asset guide](/guides/on-demand/upload-a-video-asset#api) to do so.

<CodeBlockTabItem value="javascript" label="javascript">

```js
const getAssets = await fetch("https://livepeer.studio/api/asset", {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LP_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
});
```

## Step 2: Export the asset to IPFS
Once you have an $ASSET_ID, you can make a request to update the asset's storage location.

<CodeBlockTabItem value="javascript" label="javascript">

```js
const exportAssetToIPFS = await fetch("https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id}", {
    method: "PATCH",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LP_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: {
        "storage": {
            "ipfs": {}
        }
    }
});
```
