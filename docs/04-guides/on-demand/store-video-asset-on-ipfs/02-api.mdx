The Livepeer API allows you to send video files to Livepeer and get them 
ready for optimized playback. Videos can be provided either by you (static content) 
or your users, given your application offers an interface for them to do so. 

You should be familiar with [Assets](/reference/api/get-assets) and [Tasks](/reference/api/get-tasks) 
and have generated a [Livepeer Studio API key](/quickstart/).

## Caveats
- Currently assets cannot be deleted from the default Livepeer Studio storage. 
You can customize any additional storage though.
- Only IPFS is supported as an additional storage provider. We're currently working on adding 
additional storage providers. If you have requirements for a particular storage provider, please 
reach out to us at [help@livepeer.studio](mailto:help@livepeer.studio). 

## Step 1: Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset
Get the `asset.id` of an existing asset. An `asset.id` can be found in the response object of any API call working with assets.
If you haven't created an asset yet, you can follow the [upload a video asset guide](/guides/on-demand/upload-a-video-asset#api) to do so.

## Step 2: Store the asset on IPFS
Once you have an `asset.id`, you can make a request to update the asset's storage location.
