# Store Video Asset on IPFS

This guide provides you the instructions to store a video asset on IPFS from the [Livepeer Studio Dashboard](#dashboard) 
or through the [Livepeer API](#api).

## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you will need to meet the following dependencies for 
working with the On Demand feature:

- [A Livepeer Studio account](https://livepeer.studio/login)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Access to the [API Reference](https://docs.livepeer.studio/references)
- An [API Key](https://docs.livepeer.studio/guides/livestreaming/api-key) to call the VOD API
    - Note: Calling the API from the frontend requires an API key with CORS access allowed

Throughout this guide you'll see a few terms mentioned multiple times, asset and task:
- **Asset**: an object that represents a file
- **Task**: an action taken on the file

## Dashboard

The Livepeer Studio Dashboard is a frontend interface that enables users to interact 
with Livepeerâ€™s features without any code. Using the Dashboard you can upload a video 
quickly just by uploading it to Livepeer.

### Step 1: [Log in](https://livepeer.studio/login) to the Livepeer Studio Dashboard

## API

The Video-on-Demand (VOD) API allows you to send video files to Livepeer and get them 
ready for optimized playback. Those videos can be provided either by you (static content) 
or your users, given your application offers an interface for them to do so.
