title: Quickstart
---

This Quickstart guide includes a step-by-step process to get you started developing an application with the Livepeer Studio API (for `Node.js` and `Axios` apps). With the Livepeer Studio toolkit, you will be able to develop an application that follows our complete livestreaming cycle and best practice guidelines to:

- [Create a livestream](/guides#create-a-livestream)
- [Record a livestream](/guides#record-a-livestream)
- [Playback a livestream](/guides/#list-recorded-sessions) using the [Livepeer Studio API](/references) with `Node.js` and `Axios`

> **Note:** Although the above is not restricted to `Node.js` and `Axios`, Livepeer Studio currently only supports `Node.js` and `Axios`. **In the future we will support other programming languages as well**.

## What You Need to Know

- Familiarity with [Livepeer Studio core concepts](/core-concepts)
- Experience working with `Node.js`
- Experience working with `Axios`

## What You Can Build Here

Some kinds of applications you may build with this Quickstart guide include but are not limited to:

| Implementation                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OBS Professional Broadcasting (e.g. Livestreaming changing camera angles, or multiple "views" within a screen)                 |
| Livepeer Studio In-browser Applications <br />**Note:** Capabilities are available for implementations of InBrowser platforms. |
| Multi-streaming                                                                                                                |

> **Note:** This Quickstart guide follows an implementation for building a livestream application with **OBS Professional Broadcasting**:

## Livestreaming Methods

You can choose which [method](/core-concepts/tech-overview#methods) to use to stream for your implementation (e.g., Inbrowser, Mobile, Zoom, ...)

## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you can set up your environment for developing your application:

- **Operating System:** Livepeer Studio services can be run on any operating system.

- **IDE:** You can use any development environment that supports your library (VS Code, Sublime, etc.).

- **Complete these steps** to finalize your setup:

1. **[Sign up for a Free Livepeer Account](https://livepeer.studio/login)**
1. [Get an API key](/guides/livestreaming/api-key)
1. Download and install [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Install [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
1. Access the [Livepeer Studio API Reference](/references)

## Create a Livestream

1.  To create a stream you will need to get the following parameters:

- A `Stream key`
- An `RTMP ingest URL`
- A `playbackURL`

<!-- link the above to existing documentation-->

> **Note:** Be sure to store them to access for future steps.

### Request

The following request will return:

- `playbackId`
- `id` of the stream
- `streamKey` available

> **Note:** These parameters will be used in [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) along with an `id` to enable recording for the stream.

```js
const axios = require("axios");
const rtmpURL = "https://livepeer.studio/api";
const playbackURL = "https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8";

const createStream = async () => {
  const response = await axios.post("https://livepeer.studio/api/stream", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    data: JSON.stringify({
      name: "test_stream",
      profiles: [
        {
          name: "720p",
          bitrate: 2000000,
          fps: 30,
          width: 1280,
          height: 720,
        },
        {
          name: "480p",
          bitrate: 1000000,
          fps: 30,
          width: 854,
          height: 480,
        },
        {
          name: "360p",
          bitrate: 500000,
          fps: 30,
          width: 640,
          height: 360,
        },
      ],
    }),
  });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

### Response

```JSON
{
   "lastSeen": 0,
   "isActive": false,
   "record": false,
   "suspended": false,
   "sourceSegments": 0,
   "transcodedSegments": 0,
   "sourceSegmentsDuration": 0,
   "transcodedSegmentsDuration": 0,
   "sourceBytes": 0,
   "transcodedBytes": 0,
   "profiles": [
       {
           "name": "720p",
           "bitrate": 2000000,
           "fps": 30,
           "width": 1280,
           "height": 720
       },
       {
           "name": "480p",
           "bitrate": 1000000,
           "fps": 30,
           "width": 854,
           "height": 480
       },
       {
           "name": "360p",
           "bitrate": 500000,
           "fps": 30,
           "width": 640,
           "height": 360
       }
   ],
   "name": "test_stream",
   "kind": "stream",
   "userId": "eada599f-3d58-499b-ba24-c7f3faf988de",
   "renditions": {},
   "id": "05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd",
   "createdAt": 1654273038907,

   "createdByTokenName": "Test",
   "multistream": {
       "targets": []
   }
}
```

From the API response, we now have:

- A `playbackId` for our `playbackURl`
- The `id` of the stream to enable the recording for the stream
- A `streamKey` to use in OBS

2. Include these variables for later use:

**Stored Variables**

```js
let playBackId = "05b0572n8voz1t4w";
let id = "05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd";
let streamKey = "05b0-nyoa-jf0p-s2x8";
```

## Start streaming with OBS

Now that you have created a new stream, you can start streaming in OBS.

1. First, follow the [OBS tutorial](/guides/livestreaming/obs).

## Verify the stream is running

2. Once you complete the OBS Tutorial, you can verify that the stream is running by setting the following value:

```
/api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": isActive, "value": true}
```

### Request

```js
const streamOn = async () => {
 const response = await axios.get("https://livepeer.studio/api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": "isActive", "value": true}", {
   headers: {
     'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
     'Content-Type': 'application/json'
   },
   data: JSON.stringify({
     "record": true
 })
 });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
}
```

### Response

```json

"isActive": true

```

## Record a Livestream

The setting for recording a livestream indicates:

- The ability to record a livestream, and
- **Save** the livestream for later views

**By default**, this setting is set to `"record": false`. You will be able to change this in the following steps:

> **Note:** Recording a livestream is not a development requirement for the livestreaming process. However, most streamers prefer to have a recording of their streams to show later, e.g. broadcasting/streaming/content creating

## Enable recording

1. You will make the request to turn the recording setting `on` and record your stream:

### Request

```js
const recordOn = async () => {
  const response = await axios.patch(
    "https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}/record",
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      data: JSON.stringify({
        record: true,
      }),
    }
  );
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

### Response

The response should return a `204` message and `"record": true` in the livestream object.

Once the live stream is complete, you can stop the stream after 6 minutes from the end of the streaming session.

## List recorded sessions

1. Confirm that the session has been recorded:

### Request

```js
const getRecording = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(
    "https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}/sessions?record=1",
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    }
  );
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

### Response

```json
"createdAt": 1654285544854,
       "ingestRate": 0,
       "renditions": {},
       "outgoingRate": 0,
       "recordingStatus": "ready",
       "recordingUrl": "https://livepeercdn.com/recordings/05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd/index.m3u8",
       "mp4Url": "https://livepeercdn.com/recordings/05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd/source.mp4"
```

## List assets

Retrieve the `playbackURL` to play the recording

2. Get the `playbackURL`:

### Request

- Use `/api/asset`

```js
const getPlaybackURL = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get("https://livepeer.studio/api/asset", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

### Response

This returns the `playbackURL` at the bottom of the response which we will use to view the recording.

}
```

## Playback a Livestream

The response from requesting an asset in the API will return the `playbackId` which is used for the `playbackUrl`. https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8

> **Note:** You can also get the `playbackUrl` from the dashboard of the stream.

## Options to view a livestream

There are different options to view a livestream.

**For example:**

You can check a recorded video via [Bitmovin test player](https://bitmovin.com/demos/stream-test?format=dash&manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fbitmovin-a.akamaihd.net%2Fcontent%2FMI201109210084_1%2Fmpds%2Ff08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.mpd), then:

1. Copy and paste your `playbackURL` in the `Stream box` and `select` the option for `HLS`.

2. To see the recorded live stream:

- Click the `Load Settings` button when you press `play`.

3. For other options of playback:

- **_For Safari web browser only_**, you can directly paste the `playbackURL` in the address bar.

- **\*Alternatively**, you can build your own video player: **_See_** [How to implement a player in the front end](https://github.com/codentell/livepeer-player-tutorial).

> **Note:** The process of playing back a recorded video is the same as above.

> **Note:** There are two ways to playback a recorded stream:

- via the API by getting the asset and the response returns a `playbackUrl`, or
- download it via the `downloadUrl` link. (ALternatively you can get the download link from the [dashboard](https://livepeer.studio/login?next=%2Fdashboard))
