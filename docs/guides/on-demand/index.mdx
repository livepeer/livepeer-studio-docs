On Demand encompases the Video On Demand product that supports methods to import and manage videos.

## About On Demand

Once a video (`asset`) is **uploaded**, it is **transcoded** via the network (***See*** [Transcoding on the Livepeer Network](https://docs.livepeer.org/video-miners/#transcoding-on-the-livepeer-network). This process generates information for video playback and management of the video asset(s) stored by Livepeer studio on the Cloud or, alternatively, to IPFS. Information on the uploaded `asset`, e.g. `playbackUrl`, can be retrieved for viewing via a video player or downloaded using the `downloadUrl`.

On Demand includes the features of our Web3 Video SDK and Resources to:

- Upload an Asset (**C**) - A direct upload URL is generated and the asset provided in the `.mp4` file format is sent to the Livepeer Network for transcoding and saved in storage.
- Update an Asset (**U**)
- List an Asset (**R**) - to receive a specified asset or asset list
- Delete an Asset (**D**) - remove an asset from storage
- Play an Asset  (**R**) - retrieve an asset or list of assets for playback
- Engagement Metrics (data) - streaming statistics

### Tasks

Tasks providing visibility into the progress of video uploads; what is being uploaded, upload progress, and errors.

Statuses of tasks:
    - `task.spawned`— An upload task has been created
    - `task.updated` — Indicates that the status of the task has changed. Payload will indicate the status of the task
    - `task.succeeded`— An upload task status is `ready`
    - `task.failed` — An upload task has errored

- status of assets
    - `asset.created` — An asset has been created after upload is complete
    - `asset.updated` — An asset has been updated (metadata has been updated, renamed)
    - `asset.error` — An error has occurred with an asset
    - `asset.ready`-- An asset is ready, with no errors, and is ready to be played
    - `asset.deleted` — An asset has been deleted


## Asset Resources

When adding a video file, this asynchronous process requires processing the file with resources:

### Listing `assets`

Once an asset is uploaded `/request-upload`, the response will return the `id` of that asset. 

You can access the status of assets:
- status of assets
    - `asset.created` — An asset has been created after upload is complete
    - `asset.updated` — An asset has been updated (metadata has been updated, renamed)
    - `asset.error` — An error has occurred with an asset
    - `asset.ready`-- An asset is ready, with no errors, and is ready to be played
    - `asset.deleted` — An asset has been deleted

### Uploading `assets` 

Refers to the API end point that allows users to upload 
Generates a URL for storage if the Upload option is used
a File is provided if it is transcoded in the Livepeer Network, gets passed back to Livepeer Studio, and is saved in storage

- via a downloadable URL, or 
- uploading an `.mp4` file from local storage. 


### TasksThe Stored asset now contains the playbackUrl used for viewing


Tasks provide visibility into the progress of video uploads -- what is being uploaded, upload progress, and errors.

Statuses of tasks:
    - `task.spawned`— An upload task has been created
    - `task.updated` — Indicates that the status of the task has changed. Payload will indicate the status of the task
    - `task.succeeded`— An upload task status is `ready`
    - `task.failed` — An upload task has errored


### Update an `asset`

### Delete an `asset` 

### Store an `asset` 

Store assets for playback on Google Cloud, or alternatively on IPFS. The asset contains the `playbackUrl` used for viewing a rendition of it based on the device and network when the `request` is made.

## On Demand API

You can send video files to Livepeer and get them ready for optimized playback via the [API On Demand](/references/vod/). You and your users can provide videos (static content), given your application offers an interface for this.


### Caveats

It is important to **note** that:

- Files are limited to 1GB. 

Files greater than this size are likely to error out during upload or processing.

- Only `MP4` files encoded with `H.264` and `AAC` are supported.
