title: Mint a Video NFT
---

This guide provides information and instructions about minting video NFTs using the API:

- Mint the Video NFT with Livpeer Studio
- Work with a Contract
- Create the Transaction
- View the NFT

## What You Can Build

- Your own Video NFT

## What You Need to Know

- Familiarity with [Livepeer Studio Concepts](/core-concepts)
- Experience developing with APIs

## Technical Preparation

- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- `Nodejs`
- [Build a Video NFT app](https://livepeer.studio/docs/guides/video-nfts/build-a-video-nft-app)
- [Get an API key](https://livepeer.studio/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/api-key)

> **Note:** If you know how to use `tokenURI` to mint an NFT only **Step 1.** and use the nftMetadataUrl field as the `tokenURI` for your NFT. The URL is compatible with both ERC-721
> and ERC-1155.

## Minting a Video NFT using Livepeer Studio

1. Upload the Video and configure the metadata for your NFT

- You can use the `@livepeer/video-nft.` [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livepeer/video-nft) script to have a local file uploaded to Livepeer, exported to IPFS, and then mint the NFT out of it.

- Alternatively, if you do not have `node` installed, you can use
  [this script](https://gist.github.com/victorges/3369cc04c0002a63b2fab33079d8827e)
  (`bash`) which works similarly.

2. Get a [Livepeer API key] to use from the tool. (/guides/api-key)

3. Then simply run `npx @livepeer/video-nft`. The CLI will ask you for any
   the information it needs and, in the end, will give you a URL for a simple page for
   minting the NFT.

Some tips in case you use it often:

- Install it in your system with `npm install -g @livepeer/video-nft` and then
  use it as `video-nft <args>`
- Set the API key on the `LP_API_KEY` environment variable to avoid the prompt
  for it.
- Send all required properties as CLI arguments and avoid all the other prompts
  (good for scripting).
  - The filename can be passed as a single positional argument to the command;
  - The asset name can be set via the `--asset-name` flag and;
  - The NFT metadata can be specified on the `--nft-metadata` flag. It accepts
    either a raw JSON or a file with the metadata.

**For Example:**

```jsx
$ npx @livepeer/video-nft
We need to install the following packages:
  @livepeer/video-nft@0.1.3
Ok, to proceed? (y) y
? Enter your Livepeer API key (learn more at http://bit.ly/lp-api-key): ********
****************************
Tip: You can set the LP_API_KEY environment variable to avoid this prompt.
? What file do you want to use? nasa25.mp4
You can also send the filename as an argument to this command.
? What name do you want to give to your NFT? NASA 25th bday
? Would you like to customize the NFT metadata? No

  "nftMetadataGatewayUrl": "https://ipfs.livepeer.studio/ipfs/QmR2SaapDATg7q9vVG2NSaGbSE3KUBLfUN49Lb737HY88h"
}
5. Mint your NFT at:
https://livepeer.studio/mint-nft?tokenUri=ipfs://QmR2SaapDATg7q9vVG2NSaGbSE3KUBLfUN49Lb737HY88h
```

> **Note:** The <code>nftMetadataUrl</code> is what you need to remember for custom minting of the NFT.

The equivalent command avoiding all the prompts would be:

```json
$ export LP_API_KEY=<your API key obtained from the Livepeer dashboard>
$ npx @livepeer/video-nft nasa25.mp4 --asset-name "NASA 25th bday" --nft-metadata '{"description":"NASA's commemorative video for their 25th birthday"'
```

## Mint your NFT!

Livepeer provides pre-deployed ERC-721 contracts in the Polygon mainnet and testnet. If you are happy just using one of those, you can follow the link printed at the end of the `video-nft` CLI.

A minimal UI should show where all you have to do is connect your MetaMask wallet (currently the only supported one) and click the `Mint NFT.` button to get your NFT setup.

> **Note:** If you are happy with the NFT minted on the page above, you can stop here!

    Keep going if you are curious about how to create custom ERC-721 contracts or have your NFT minting app. You can reference the duplicate exported files
    on IPFS for your custom NFTs, grabbed from the script output.

## Install web3

In this example, you will use [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) as the Eth service provider. It is assumed you have already deployed an ERC721 contract, which you can do so by following this
[How to Create an NFT](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/how-to-create-an-nft) guide.

1. In your project home directory, run:

```json
npm install @alch/alchemy-web3
```

2. Create a mint-nft.js file\*\*

3. Inside your `scripts` directory, create a `mint-nft.js` file and add the
   following lines of code:

```json
require('dotenv').config();
const API_URL = process.env.API_URL;
const { createAlchemyWeb3 } = require("@alch/alchemy-web3");
const web3 = createAlchemyWeb3(API_URL);
```

4. Grab your contract ABI

The contract ABI (Application Binary Interface) is the interface to interact
with our smart contract. Hardhat automatically generates an ABI for us and saves
it in the MyNFT.json file. To use this, we'll need to parse out the
contents by adding the following lines of code to our `mint-nft.js` file:

```json
const contract = require("../artifacts/contracts/MyNFT.sol/MyNFT.json");
```

If you want to see the ABI, you can print it to your console:

```json
console.log(JSON.stringify(contract.abi));
```

To run `mint-nft.js' and see your ABI printed to the console. Navigate to your terminal and run:

```json
node scripts/mint-nft.js
```

5. Create an instance of your contract

- To interact with the contract, create an instance of it in the code. This requires the contract address which you can get from the deployment of [Etherscan](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/) by looking up the address you used to deploy the contract.

For this example, our contract address is:

`0xD6A8375E7A3BE7157f9bBD9D53348b39d75bEb3E`

6. Next, we will use the web3 `contract` method to create our contract using the ABI
   and address. In your `mint-nft.js` file, add the following:

```json
const contractAddress = "0xD6A8375E7A3BE7157f9bBD9D53348b39d75bEb3E";
const nftContract = new web3.eth.Contract(contract.abi, contractAddress);
```

7. Update the `.env` file

To create and send transactions to the Ethereum chain, use
your public Ethereum account address to get the account `nonce` (explained
below).

8. Add your public key to your `.env` file —if you completed part 1 of the
   tutorial, our .`env` file should now look like this:

```json
API_URL = "https://eth-ropsten.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key"
PRIVATE_KEY = "your-private-account-address"
PUBLIC_KEY = "your-public-account-address"
```

## Create your transaction

Define a function called `mintNFT(tokenData)` and create the transaction by doing the following:

1. Grab your `PRIVATE_KEY` and `PUBLIC_KEY` from the `.env` file.
2. Next, we'll need to figure out the account `nonce`; the nonce specification to keep track of the number of transactions sent from your address— required for security purposes and to prevent [replay attacks](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/resources/blockchain-glossary#account-nonce).
3. To get the number of transactions sent from your address, use [getTransactionCount](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/documentation/alchemy-api-reference/json-rpc#eth_gettransactioncount).
4. Finally, you can set up our `transaction` with the following info:
5. "from ': PUBLIC_KEY`: The origin of our transaction is our public address . "to ': contractAddress`: The contract we wish to interact with and send the
   transaction
6. "nonce': nonce`: The account nonce with the number of transactions sent
   from the address
7. "gas': estimatedGas`: The estimated gas needed to complete the transaction
8. "maxPriorityFeePerGas': estimatedFee`: The estimated fee to bid per gas.
9. `'data': nftContract.methods.mintNFT(PUBLIC_KEY, tokenURI).encodeABI()` : The
   computation to perform in this transaction— which in this case is minting an NFT

Your `mint-nft.js` file should look like this:

```jsx
require("dotenv").config();
const API_URL = process.env.API_URL;
const PUBLIC_KEY = process.env.PUBLIC_KEY;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;

const { createAlchemyWeb3 } = require("@alch/alchemy-web3");
const web3 = createAlchemyWeb3(API_URL);

const contract = require("../artifacts/contracts/MyNFT.sol/MyNFT.json");
const contractAddress = "0xD6A8375E7A3BE7157f9bBD9D53348b39d75bEb3E";
const nftContract = new web3.eth.Contract(contract.abi, contractAddress);

async function mintNFT(tokenURI) {
  const nonce = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(PUBLIC_KEY, "latest"); //get latest nonce

  //the transaction
  const tx = {
    from: PUBLIC_KEY,
    to: contractAddress,
    nonce: nonce,
    gas: 500000,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: 2999999987,
    data: nftContract.methods.mintNFT(PUBLIC_KEY, tokenURI).encodeABI(),
  };
}
```

10. Sign the transaction

Now that you have created the transaction, you will need to sign it to send it off. This is where you will use your private key:

`web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction` will provide the transaction hash, which you can use to ensure the transaction was mined and did not get dropped by the network. You may notice in the transaction signing section some error checking has been added to know if the transaction successfully went through.

```jsx
require("dotenv").config();
const API_URL = process.env.API_URL;
const PUBLIC_KEY = process.env.PUBLIC_KEY;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;

const { createAlchemyWeb3 } = require("@alch/alchemy-web3");
const web3 = createAlchemyWeb3(API_URL);

const contract = require("../artifacts/contracts/MyNFT.sol/MyNFT.json");
const contractAddress = "0xD6A8375E7A3BE7157f9bBD9D53348b39d75bEb3E";
const nftContract = new web3.eth.Contract(contract.abi, contractAddress);

async function mintNFT(tokenURI) {
  const nonce = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(PUBLIC_KEY, "latest"); //get latest nonce

  //the transaction
  const tx = {
    from: PUBLIC_KEY,
    to: contractAddress,
    nonce: nonce,
    gas: 500000,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: 2999999987,
    data: nftContract.methods.mintNFT(PUBLIC_KEY, tokenURI).encodeABI(),
  };

  const signedTx = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(tx, PRIVATE_KEY);
  const transactionReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
    signedTx.rawTransaction
  );

  console.log(`Transaction receipt: ${JSON.stringify(transactionReceipt)}`);
}
```

11. Call `mintNFT` and run `node scripts/mint-nft.js`

Remember the `nfcMetadataUrl` from uploading your uploaded to Livepeer? Now it is
time to use it to mint the NFT.

Altogether, the code should look like this:

```jsx
require("dotenv").config();
const API_URL = process.env.API_URL;
const PUBLIC_KEY = process.env.PUBLIC_KEY;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;

const { createAlchemyWeb3 } = require("@alch/alchemy-web3");
const web3 = createAlchemyWeb3(API_URL);

const contract = require("../artifacts/contracts/MyNFT.sol/MyNFT.json");
const contractAddress = "0xD6A8375E7A3BE7157f9bBD9D53348b39d75bEb3E";
const nftContract = new web3.eth.Contract(contract.abi, contractAddress);

async function mintNFT(tokenURI) {
  const nonce = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(PUBLIC_KEY, "latest"); //get latest nonce

  //the transaction
  const tx = {
    from: PUBLIC_KEY,
    to: contractAddress,
    nonce: nonce,
    gas: 500000,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: 2999999987,
    data: nftContract.methods.mintNFT(PUBLIC_KEY, tokenURI).encodeABI(),
  };

  const signedTx = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(tx, PRIVATE_KEY);
  const transactionReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
    signedTx.rawTransaction
  );

  console.log(`Transaction receipt: ${JSON.stringify(transactionReceipt)}`);
}

mintNFT("ipfs://QmTju7Q4iPbosYJfFvSdxcRkT4KPYCpem31Z6mGL979Kkg");
```

12. Run `node scripts/mint-nft.js` to deploy your NFT. After a couple of
    seconds, you should see a response like this in your terminal:

```jsx
The hash of your transaction is: 0x13edd7e9f1349ac7a92ed187686afd7c48e211f28ac1041b700d9691cc816455
Check Alchemy's Mempool to view the status of your transaction!
```

### View the NFT

Using the `mint-nft.js`, you can mint as many NFTs as you want! Just be sure to
pass in a new `tokenURI` describing the NFT's metadata --otherwise, you will just
end up making many identical NFTs with different IDs.

Now that you have minted your video NFT! You can take a look at the NFT:

- on Etherscan through the contract address, or
- on OpenSea at `https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/{contract_address}/{id}`
