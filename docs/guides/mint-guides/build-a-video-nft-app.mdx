This brief guide provides information about Building a Video NFT App:

- Accessing the JavaScript SDK
- Examples
- A sample app

## What You Need to Know

- Familiarity with [Livepeer Studio core concepts](/core-concepts)
- Experience working with APIs and SDKs
- Working with [API Keys](/guides/livestreaming/api-key)

Livepeer provides a [helpful JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livepeer/video-nft) for
building Video NFT apps. You can use it from any part of your application stack, like your backend and/or your frontend.

It includes utilities for:

- Opening a file from your users device and uploading it to the Livepeer API
- Interacting with the Livepeer VOD API, including requesting an upload URL, transcoding the video for an optimized NFT, and exporting it to IPFS
- Minting the actual NFT on an Ethereum/EVM-compatible blockchain

You can find the SDK on npm as [@livepeer/video-nft](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livepeer/video-nft) with its detailed documentation on [GitHub pages](https://livepeer.github.io/video-nft/).

> **Note:** When building applications with the SDK, you might also find it useful to learn
> and make use of [CORS-enabled API keys](https://livepeer.studio/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/api-key#cors), in case you want to get started without a backend to talk with the Livepeer API.

> **Note:** If all you want is to mint individual Video NFTs but you are not building your own minting app, you may prefer to follow our [Mint a Video NFT](/guides/video-nfts/mint-a-video-nft)guide or just use the Mint NFT page in our dashboard.

## Usage Examples

### CLI

The first application to use the SDK was the Video NFT CLI provided by the same `npm` package. Although it shares the project with the SDK, it is just a regular user of it like any other application. You can learn more how to use it in our [Mint a Video NFT](/guides/video-nfts/mint-a-video-nft) guide, and check [its source code on GitHub](https://github.com/livepeer/video-nft/blob/fc10dbc5b758c864b26e81f7e031268eb174f01c/src/cli/index.ts#L10).

### Mint NFT page

Livepeer also provides the [Mint NFT page](https://livepeer.studio/mint-nft) which uses this SDK. It complements the CLI in the sense of connecting to MetaMask to mint the file uploaded by the CLI, but it can also be used standalone by uploading the file directly on the UI as well.

The source code is inside the code for our dashboard. It is built in React with
next.js and you can check [the code for the page on GitHub](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-com/blob/898974c72c81b954113d51509b7d09c737e1ea95/packages/www/pages/mint-nft/index.tsx#L102) as well.

### Sample App

We are also building a specific sample app using the NFT SDK. Its source code can also be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/codentell/video-nft-sample), and is currently being hosted on [Vercel](https://video-nft-sample.vercel.app).
