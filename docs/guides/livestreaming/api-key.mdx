The following provides instructions to create an API key and information about working with API access:

- Get an API key via the Livepeer Studio Dashboard
- Usage - adding the `Authorization` header
- CORS-enabled API keys and access

## About Working with Livepeer Studio API Keys

An API key is required to make requests of the Livepeer Studio API (the API).

> It is important to **note:** that you do not need to create an API key if you are creating and configuring livestreams using **only** the [Livepeer Studio Dashboard](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard).

When you create a new API key, **be sure to copy and secure the value displayed to you.** This is the sole secret you will have to use when making requests to the Livepeer Studio API, so **share and store it with caution**.

1. Log in to the Livepeer Studio Dashboard and navigate to
   [the API keys page within the Developers tab](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/developers/api-keys).

On this page, you can manage your API keys including creating or deleting them and monitoring their usage.

## Get an API Key using the Livepeer Studio Dashboard

Make sure you register your Livepeer Studio Account and get API Key:

1. Create a **free** [Livepeer Studio Account](https://livepeer.studio/register)

2. Click `Create API Key`. A dialogue should appear.

3. In the dialogue field, enter a name for your API key.

4. Click `Create`. Your dashboard should look like this:

> **Note:** Livepeer Studio currently allows you to reveal the secret of any existing API key. However, this behavior may change in the future. **Make sure to persist the API key safely.**

> You will always be able to delete an API key and create a new one as necessary.

## Usage

To use an API key, you can simply add an `Authorization` header to your request with the`Bearer` scheme and the API key as the value.

**For example:**

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
  https://livepeer.studio/api/user/me
```

## CORS

**By default**, API keys can only be used from a backend server. This ensures maximum security and prevents you from accidentally exposing your account should you include the secret API key on a public web page.

### API Keys with CORS access

If you are developing a frontend application and want to get started quickly with the API, you can also create an API key with CORS access enabled. API keys created with this option can be used from the browser from any origin for which it is configured.

> **Note:** An origin is just a combination of a scheme, like: `https`, with a domain like `example.com`.

### Using a non-standard port

If you are using a non-standard port, you will also need to include the port number, e.g.:

- `http://localhost:8080` when developing locally on `port 8080`, or

- `https://my.app.io` after deploying it on a public domain

### Enable CORS access

1. Tick the `Allow CORS access` checkbox when creating your API key.

2. You will then be prompted to add all the origins that you would like the API key to be used from:

**Recommended**

3. We recommend adding the minimal list of origins to your API key.

4. Ideally, you may also create separate API keys to be used for development or production.

5. At your discretion, you can use the same API key for all your environments and allow all the origins for it. You can also just add the `*` special value to allow the key to be used from any origin.

> **Note:** CORS is only a client-side check that browsers make, and sometimes does not prevent the API from being called. It also does not prevent the API key from being used from other places like a backend or a custom client. <br/> <br/> For an additional layer of security, we also limit the access of the CORS-enabled keys to the API. Continue reading for more information.

### CORS restricted endpoints

By default, CORS-enabled API keys have restricted access to the API. This means that they are only allowed to call some specific endpoints of the API.

This is another intermediate security measure so that even if a malicious actor snoops the API key from your web page, they still will not be able to access the most sensitive data in your account.

For example, APIs that expose PIIs, payment information, or list API resources created by other users are disallowed.

### Access List of CORS restricted API endpoints

The following are the main API endpoints that a restricted CORS API key will have access to. These endpoints allow you to use all the features of the [Video NFT SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livepeer/video-nft) from the browser.

| API Group | API                                                                                               | Description                                    |

## Non-restricted API Access

If your application needs further access to the API, we strongly recommend that you run a backend to secure an API key and call the API privately. From it, you can also perform any custom authentication with your frontend and validate the API calls to protect your Livepeer Studio account. Check the [livepeer-web-api-proxy](https://github.com/victorges/livepeer-web-api-proxy) for a sample project with such a backend.

If you are aware of the implications but still want to create an API key with full access to your account, you can do so by ticking the `Full API access` checkbox when creating your API key.

An API key with `Full API access` will be able to access and manage every information in your account, including:

- all your contact info provided on registration,
- change your billing plan,
- list and delete all the streams, and
- assets stored in your account
