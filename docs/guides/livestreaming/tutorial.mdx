## Technical Preparation

There are multiple ways to livestream with Livepeer Studio. The only prerequisite
for using Livepeer Studio is to be able to create an RTMP stream.


- **Operating System:** Livepeer Studio services can be run on any operating system

1. **[Sign up for a free Livepeer account](https://livepeer.studio/login)**
1. **[Get Stream Key](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams)**



## Create a Stream

Login to the Livepeer Studio Dashboard, and navigate to the [Streams](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams) page,
located in the left-hand menu. Click on the `+ Create stream` button on the top
right corner. When you name your stream, pick a unique name and include URL
compatible characters only.

Then you’ll be redirected to a detailed page with information about your new
stream. Keep this page open. You will need the stream key for both using OBS or WebRTMP methods. 

Visit [here](./create-a-stream) for a detailed tutorial.

### Using OBS Broadcaster

OBS is the way that most users stream into Livepeer because it is easy to use and offers a high degree of customization. OBS is open source and free to use. 

Visit [here](./obs) for a detailed tutorial.

### Using In-browser Broadcaster

The in-browser approach is when streamers are using a website that allows them to stream directly from it without additional software. There isn’t a need to download anything as everything is already set up on the web page. 

 For streamers who don’t need as much control over their settings, or perhaps don’t want to download software to start streaming like OBS, in-browser streaming is a good option. 

Visit [here](./webrtmp) for a detailed tutorial.

## Playback a Livestream

Navigate to your [stream detail](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams) page in the Livepeer Studio Dashboard, and copy the `playbackUrl`.
The playback URL is an `.m3u8` file, the basis for the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) format.

There are different options to view a livestream.

**For example:**

You can check a recorded video via [Bitmovin test player](https://bitmovin.com/demos/stream-test?format=dash&manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fbitmovin-a.akamaihd.net%2Fcontent%2FMI201109210084_1%2Fmpds%2Ff08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.mpd)

1. Copy and paste your `playbackURL` in the `Stream box` and `select` the option for `HLS`.

1. To see the recorded live stream:

    - Click the  `Load Settings` button when you press `play`.

1. For other options of playback:

    - ***For Safari web browser only***,  you can directly paste the `playbackURL` in the address bar.

    - ***Alternatively**, you can build your own video player: ***See*** [How to implement a player in the front end](https://github.com/codentell/livepeer-player-tutorial)

> **Note:** The process of playing back a recorded video is the same as above.

> **Note:** There are two ways to playback a recorded stream, via the API by getting the asset and the response returns a `playbackUrl` or download it via the `downloadUrl` link. (ALternatively you can get the download link from the dashboard)
