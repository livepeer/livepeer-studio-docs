title: Create Streams

This guide provides instructions and information about creating a livestream:

- Understanding the `stream` object
- Ways to create a stream object
- Working with example API requests
- No-code stream creation (optional)

## About the `stream` Object

**It is important to note,** that the`stream` object is the core building block of the Livepeer Studio platform.

In Livepeer Studio, the`stream` object has unique configuration data and metadata
about all [livestream sessions](/terminology) that are associated with the stream.

> **Note:** historically, a `stream` object with a `parentId`represented a single livestream session. This type of "child-session" stream object will be deprecated in an upcoming version of the API in favor of the `session` object.

## What You Need To Know

- Familiarity with Livepeer Studio core concepts
- Experience working with APIs

## What You Can Build Here

| Implementation                          | Description                             |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Create a stream for livestreaming       | Broadcast livestreams of any duration   |
| Create a stream to broadcast recordings | Broadcast 24/7 livestream of recordings |

## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you can set up your environment to prepare for developing your application:

- Sign up for a free Livepeer account
- Get an API key
- Access the [API Reference](/references/stream/)

## Ways to Create a Stream Object

There are two ways to create a stream object:

- Via the API
- Via the dashboard (no code)

## Create a stream object with a POST request to the API

Send a `POST` request to `https://livepeer.studio/api/stream`. This creates a new
Livepeer Studio `stream` object.

Use a Livepeer Studio API key as a part of the authorization header, and use a JSON
body to specify the configuration for the stream. The only parameter you are
required to set is the `name` of your stream, but we also highly recommend that
you define the `profiles` parameter with 720p, 480p and 360p renditions.

If you do not define transcoding rendition `profiles` when creating the
`stream`, no transcoding will happen. Your playback video will have the
attributes of the source stream only, will not take advantage of adaptive
bitrate streaming, and will likely buffer.

### Request

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
-d '{
  "name": "test_stream",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "720p",
      "bitrate": 2000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 720
    },
    {
      "name": "480p",
      "bitrate": 1000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 854,
      "height": 480
    },
    {
      "name": "360p",
      "bitrate": 500000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 360
    }
  ]
}' \
https://livepeer.studio/api/stream
```

### Response

This is an example response to the request above. `streamKey`, `playbackId`, and
`id` are unique to the `stream` object. You will need the `streamKey` to
broadcast live video and the `playbackId` to configure the playback URL to watch
the live stream.

```json
{
    "name":"test_stream",
    "profiles":[
        {"name":"720p","bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"width":1280,"height":720},
        {"name":"480p","bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"width":854,"height":480},
        {"name":"360p","bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"width":640,"height":360},
      ],
    "id":"ijkl61f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a",
    "createdAt":1596081229373,
    "streamKey":"abcd-uimq-jtgy-x98v",
    "playbackId":"efghb2mxupongp5k",
    {other asset object keys}
}
```

## No-code stream creation with the Livepeer Studio Dashboard

1. Log in to the Livepeer Studio Dashboard
1. Navigate to the Streams page,
   [livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams). On
   this page, you can create a new stream and delete streams. When you name your
   stream, pick a unique name and include URL-compatible characters only.
1. On the Stream page
   ([livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams)), you
   can also click on a stream to find out configuration and usage information.
