title: Record a Stream
---

This guide provides instructions on how to interact with the recording feature of a livestream:

- Create a stream with the `record` feature turned on
- Turn on the `record` feature of an existing stream
- Working with APIs
- Interact with `record` feature in the `dashboard`

## How recording works in Livepeer Studio.

- Recording is turned off by default. Recording OFF means that _new_ sessions
  are not recorded.
- Turning recording ON means that _new_ sessions are recorded.
- When updating this setting, note that in progress sessions will adhere to the
  on/off setting when the live stream began. The changed setting only applies to
  _new_ stream sessions.
- The adaptive bitrate (ABR) settings for the recording are inherited from the
  transcoding profiles set for the livestream. At this time you cannot set
  recording-specific ABR settings.
- Recording playback is delivered via Livepeer Studio's CDN by default.

> **Note:** If you are using OBS, set your keyframe interval to 2 for Livepeer Studio recording to work best.

## About the `record` Parameter

First, it’s important to understand the relationship between a Livepeer Studio
`stream` and `session`.
Every `session` has a parent `stream`. The `session` `parentId` value is the
same as the `stream` `id` value. When you set the `record` value of the parent `stream`, each new `session` adopts that value.

On a `stream` object.

- `record: true` means that each _new_ `session` is recorded.
- `record: false` means that each _new_ `session` is not recorded.

On a `session` object, the `record` value is read-only.

- `record: true` means that the `session` is actively being recorded or was
  recorded.
- `record: false` means that the session is not being recorded or was not
  recorded.

The absence of a `record` parameter on a `stream` or `session` object is
equivalent to `record: false`.

### Notable parameters for a `session` with `record:true`

- `id`: This string is the unique identifier for the `session`. This string is
  also used to form the playback URL for the recorded `session`.
- `parentId`: Equivalent to the `id` of the parent `stream` object.
- `createdAt`: This number is the timestamp when the live stream `session` began
  and the asset was created. Reported in Unix epoch time.
- `sourceSegmentsDuration`: This number is the duration in seconds of asset
  source processed. When the live stream `session` is over, this number equates
  to the length of the live stream `session` and recording.
- `recordingStatus`: This boolean appears only if `record` is `true`, and it is
  either `ready` when the recorded live stream is available for playback or
  `waiting` while the livestream is still active or just recently completed.
- `recordingUrl`: This string appears only if `record` is `true` and when
  `recordingStatus` changes to `ready`. It’s value is the .m3u8 URL to stream
  the recorded session.
- `mp4Url` : This string appears only if `record` is `true` and when
  `recordingStatus` changes to `ready`. Its value is the link to the mp4 file
  that represents the recording.

## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you can set up your environment to prepare for developing your application:

- Sign up for a free Livepeer account
- Get an API key
- Access the [API Reference](./references/stream)

## Interacting with Livestream Record Session

- Via the API
- Via the dashboard(no code)

## Recording live stream sessions with the Livepeer Studio API

Make requests of the Livepeer Studio API to turn recording on/off, find out if a
recording is ready for playback, and get the recording playback URL.

## Create Stream

The following creates a stream with the recording feature active.

**`POST /stream` to create a parent `stream` object with recording turned on.
All sessions will be recorded.**

### Requests

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer <api key>' \
-d '{
  "name": "test_stream_recording_on",
  "record": true
}' \
https://livepeer.studio/api/stream
```

### Response

Returns the `201 created` response with the following object:

```json
{
    "name":"test_stream_recording_on",
    "record":true,
    "profiles":[
        {"name":"720p","bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"width":1280,"height":720},
        {"name":"480p","bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"width":854,"height":480}],
        {"name":"360p","bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"width":640,"height":360}],
    "id":"ijkl61f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a",
    "createdAt":1596081229373,
    "streamKey":"abcd-uimq-jtgy-x98v",
    "playbackId":"efghb2mxupongp5k"
    {other asset object keys}
}
```

## Update a Stream

The following turns on the recording feature with an existing stream.
Turn recording on. All new sessions will be recorded. In progress sessions will
not be recorded.

### Turn on recording

**`PATCH /stream/{id}/record` to turn on/off recording for an existing asset**

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}/record \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{"record":true}'
```

### Response

The response should return a `204` message and `"record": true` in the livestream object.

### Turn off recording

**Turn recording off. All new sessions will not be recorded. In progress sessions
will still be recorded.**

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}/record \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{"record":false}'
```

### Response

The response should return a `204` message and `"record": false` in the livestream object.

### Get the recording status of a stream

**`GET /stream/{id}` to retrieve a `stream` and `record` value**

### Request

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}"
```

### Response

```json
{
    "name":"test_stream_recording_on",
    "record":true,
    "profiles":[
        {"name":"720p","bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"width":1280,"height":720},

### Get the information of a session

**`GET /session/{id}` to retrieve a `session`, `recordingStatus` and
`recordingUrl` value**

### Request

```bash

"https://livepeer.studio/api/session/{id}"
```

### Reponse

Returns a `200 OK` with the following:

    {other asset object keys}
}
```

## Recording settings in the Livepeer Studio Dashboard

The easiest way to turn recording on or off for a stream is to login to the
Livepeer Studio Dashboard, navigate to the  
[Streams](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams) page and
click on a stream name. On the stream detail page, you can toggle the recording
setting or use the `Actions` button in the top right hand corner and select
Enable/Disable recording. All new sessions will adopt the updated recording
setting, but changing the settings will not change the recording preference for
any active sessions.

The session recording playback URL will be available about 5 minutes after the
live stream ends and will appear in the session table at the bottom of the
stream’s page.

> **_Note:_** The session table only appears after you start your first
> live stream.
