title: Configure broadcast software
---

This guide provides information on configuring your broadcasting software:

- Ways to get the `streamKey`
- Using the `RTMP URL`

- Setting the keyframe intervals

## About Broadcasting Configuration

Understanding how to configure the broadcasting software being used so that you able to push an RTMP stream into Livepeer Studio. In order to broadcast a live stream, you’ll need a stream key.

## What You Can Build Here

| Implementation                          | Description                                                                                         |

| Set up keyframe intervals               | Adjusting the keyframe levels for optimizing the stream                                             |

## What You Need To Know

- Familiarity with Livepeer Studio core concepts
- Experience working with APIs

## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you can set up your environment to prepare for developing your application:

- Sign up for a free Livepeer Studio account
- Get an API key
- Access the [API Reference](../references/stream)

## Ways to Find Your Stream Key:

Ther are two ways to find the stream key:

- Via the API
- Via the dashboard(no code)

## Get the stream key using the API

### Getting the stream key from creating a stream

### Request

When you create a `stream` object with a `POST` request to `/api/stream`

> **Note:** The value of the `streamKey` in the response.

### Response

```json
{
  "lastSeen": 0,
  "isActive": false,
  "record": false,
  "suspended": false,
  "sourceSegments": 0,
  "transcodedSegments": 0,
  "sourceSegmentsDuration": 0,
  "transcodedSegmentsDuration": 0,
  "sourceBytes": 0,
  "transcodedBytes": 0,
  "profiles": [
    {

  "createdByTokenName": "test_stream",
  "multistream": {
    "targets": []
  }
}
```

### Getting the stream key from a stream

### Request

Make a `GET` request to `/api/stream/[id]`

> **Note** The value of the`streamKey` in the response.

### Reponse

```json
  {
      "name":"test_stream",
      "profiles":[
          {"name":"720p","bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"width":1280,"height":720},
          {"name":"480p","bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"width":854,"height":480},
          {"name":"360p","bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"width":640,"height":360},
        ],
      "id":"ijkl61f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a",
      "createdAt":1596081229373,
      "streamKey":"abcd-uimq-jtgy-x98v",
      "playbackId":"efghb2mxupongp5k",
      {other asset object keys}
  }
```

## Get the stream key with Livepeer Studio Dashboard

- Login to the Livepeer Studio Dashboard, navigate to the
  [streams list page](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams), and
  click on a stream name. Reveal and copy your secret stream key.

When configuring broadcast software to push streams, use the secret `streamKey`
and the Livepeer Studio RTMP ingest URL, `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live`.

Depending on the software used to push your RTMP stream, you’ll be prompted for
the following:

- Stream Key: In some cases, this is called a "Stream Name." Input your
  Livepeer Studio `streamKey` not the name of your stream.
- Server URL: Input the RTMP ingest URL, `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live`.
- Location or URL: Input the ingest url with the `streamKey` appended. For
  example, `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live/[streamKey]`.

## Optimization: Set keyframe intervals

Livepeer Studio works best with consistent, short keyframe intervals, ideally 2
seconds.

You should set or encourage your users to set this in their broadcasting
software. In [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), you can set this by going to
"Settings" --> "Output", change the "Output Mode" from "Simple" to "Advanced"
and set the "Keyframe interval" to 2.
