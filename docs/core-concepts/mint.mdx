Livepeer Studio makes minting video NFTs very accessible. After getting your [API Key](../../guides/livestreaming/api-key), you can upload assets to mint them to create a video NFT.

## About Minting with Livepeer Studio
When minting a video NFT, Livepeer Studio provides a `video-nft` script for you to use that includes a pre-deployed `ERC-721` on Polygon `mainnet` and Mumbai `testnet`. Installing this script on your computer prompts you to provide some information such as your API key, the video file in `.mp4` you want to use as the NFT, and the name you want to give to the NFT.

After completing the required information, your file will be transcoded by the Livepeer Network and then exported to IPFS. This generates `metadata` about your asset, including the `nftmMetadataUrl` needed for minting and a `URL` to mint on either Polygon `mainnet` or Mumbai `testnet`.

For information on creating your custom `ERC-721` contract, or to develop your NFT minting project, follow the [Minting guide](../../guides/mint-guides).
