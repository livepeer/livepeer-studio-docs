Architecture and workflows of the Livepeer Studio features are presented here with the Livepeer decentralized transcoding network.

## Options for Streaming

According to the devices being used, there are multiple options for streaming workflow, including but not limited to these commonly used methods:

- Via a streaming software
- In-Browser streaming

> **Note** To learn more about how to work with these methods, **_See_** Our [Start Livestreaming](/guides/livestreaming/tutorial) guide.

## Architecture Workflows

The following are the architecture and workflows of the different features available in Livepeer Studio utilizing the decentralized transcoding of the Livepeer network:

- Livestreaming
- Multistreaming
- On-Demand
- Mint

### Livestream Workflow

- An incoming audio/video feed from a device passes through a streaming software like OBS or a web browser via WebRTC
- Livepeer Studio sends the feed to the Livepeer network for transcoding
- The feed gets transcoded to multiple renditions and sent to the CDN
- The CDN sends a specific rendition of the feed based on the viewers' device and network capabilities when a request is made:

### Multistream Workflow

- An incoming audio/video feed from a device passes through a streaming software like OBS or a web browser via WebRTC at the same time, Livepeer Studio will redirect this feed into other streaming platforms
- Livepeer Studio sends the original feed to the Livepeer network whereby the transcoding feed gets transcoded to multiple renditions and sent to the CDN
- The CDN sends a specific rendition of the feed based on the viewer's device, and network capabilities when a request is made

### On-Demand Workflow

- An asset can be provided by **either** a downloadable URL link **or** by uploading a `.mp4` file
  - Importing a URL
    - Asset in a downloadable link is transcoded in the Livepeer Network, gets passed back to Livepeer Studio, and saved in storage
  - Uploading a file
    - Generates a URL for storage if the `Upload` option is used
    - The File is provided if it is transcoded in the Livepeer Network, gets passed back to Livepeer Studio, and is saved in storage
  - The Stored asset now contains the `playbackUrl` used for viewing
  - The CDN sends a specific rendition of the asset based on the viewer's device and network capabilities when a request is made

### Mint Workflow

- Livepeer Studio takes the `.mp4` asset and metadata provided by the user
- Writes and deploys the `smart contract`
- Passes in the metadata from the uploaded asset
- Sends the asset to the Livepeer network for transcoding
- Mints the video NFT by calling the Ethereum blockchain (Polygon layer 2 solution is used for more cost-effective gas fees)
