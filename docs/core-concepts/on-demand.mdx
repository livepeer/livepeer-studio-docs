## About Uploading with Livepeer Studio

When an asset is uploaded, it gets transcoded in the Livepeer Network.  This process generates information for playing the video, and Livepeer Studio stores the video for you. Information on the `asset` such as the `playbackUrl`, can be retrieved for viewing via either a video player, or via download with the provided `downloadUrl`.

## On Demand Capabilities

On Demand uploading includes:

| Capabilities | Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  Import assets  | An asset provided in a downloadable link is sent to the Livepeer Network for transcoding and saved in storage. | 
|  Upload assets  | A direct upload URL is generated and the asset provided in the `.mp4` file format is sent to the Livepeer Network for transcoding and saved in storage.  | 
|  Get assets | Retrieves a specific asset or list of assets with provided information such as `playbackUrl`, `playbackId`, and `downloadUrl` |
