## How Does Livepeer Studio work?

Livepeer Studio provides video infrastructure tools needed for video development. The fundamental principle for video development is that the original video (live or recorded) is compressed with encoding tools to reduce the file size for transferring and alteration (if needed). The encoded video now has to get transcoded as different renditions. These renditions are necessary so that when accessed on any device, they are the most optimized for viewing quality regardless of bandwidth.

Traditionally, transcoding takes place on a centralized server. However, Livepeer Studio takes livestreams and video assets and sends them for transcoding on the [Livepeer Decentralized Newtwork](https://livepeer.org).

## Using Livepeer Studio

Livepeer Studio features include capabilities for building versatile apps/Dapps depending on your specific needs and requirements. 

**For example:** 

- Projects that focus on creator content applications can utilize the [Livestreaming](./livestream) feature or the [On Demand](./upload) to provide previously recorded videos. 

- Using the [Mint](./mint) feature allows for the creation of video NFTs to be sold or utilized for token gating.

### Use cases

This table includes but is not limited to  the following common use cases and methods implemented with Livepeer Studio features and capabilities:

| Implementation                                                                                                 | Advantages | Challenges |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Live multistream to other video platforms (YouTube, Twitch)                                                                                              |     Stream can reach a wider audience      |    Dependent on if the application supports the use of custom RTMP URL        |
| Stream with broadcasting software (OBS) |     More professional-looking streams (can switch between different camera views)       |      Understanding of using the software      |
| Livestream with mobile applications                                                                        |            Stream anywhere with an internet connection|      Not as stable as using an ethernet connection      |
| In-browser streaming                                                                      |            Lower latency|       Not as feature-rich as using a broadcasting software like OBS     |


### Methods

Here are some examples of methods that may be used with features offered by Livepeer Studio:


| Method               | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Desktop Software** | - Livestreaming using OBS broadcasting software -> stream to transcode on the Livepeer network and viewed on a video player |
| **Mobile**           | -  Livestreaming using DJI Action2 camera and DJI Mimo app -> stream to transcode on the Livepeer network and viewed on a video player <br /><br />- Mobile livestreaming using Larix app -> stream to transcode on the Livepeer network and viewed on a video player <br /><br />- Mobile livestreaming using DroidCam app -> stream from mobile phone to OBS, then transcoded on the Livepeer network and viewed on a video player |
| **In Browser**        | - Inbrowser streaming using Agora ->  stream to transcode on the Livepeer network and viewed on a video player InBrowser streaming using 3rd party platforms such as ReStream or StreamYard <br /><br />- create custom RTMP in platform, stream to transcode on the Livepeer network and viewed on platform's in-browser dashboard |
| **On Demand**        | - Upload video to Livepeer Studio from custom-built app -> stored video gets transcoded by Livepeer network and viewed on a video player |


## Best Practices and Recommendations

When using Livepeer Studio for development, details related to video have to be taken into consideration, such as:

- Proper formats of video files
- Reliable internet connection 
- Proper video setting in broadcasting software for streaming
- File sizes
- Video players
