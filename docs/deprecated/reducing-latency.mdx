# Tips for reducing latency

Livepeer.com routes your live streams to the nearest available datacenter to
ensure your streamers and live stream viewers have a consistent, high quality
experience with the minimum latency Livepeer.com can provide.

These globally-optimized URLs are the best option for nearly all Livepeer.com
users.

- Stream into: `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream-key}`
- Playback from: `https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`

Also, If you created your stream via the Livepeer.com API, confirm your profile
bitrate settings are
[reasonable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/hls_authoring_specification_for_apple_devices).

Lastly, sometimes, the source stream is causing poor playback performance even
though you are using the globally-optimized URLs above and good bitrate
settings. The source stream is the stream sent from your broadcast software.
Livepeer.com serves the source stream with the transcoded renditions via the
playback URL.

One way to test if the source stream is causing problems is by inputting the
playback URL in the Livepeer.com [Test Player](https://livepeer.com/app/test-player). The Test
Player is only available to logged in users.

First take a look at the Session Ingest Rate graph at the bottom of the page. If
the chart shows a lot of sharp peaks and valleys, this indicates your
broadcasting workflow is unstable. The RTMP stream hitting the Livepeer Studio ingest
server has problems. Try ensuring a stronger internet connection at the source
via a wired ethernet connection or by broadcasting on a more reliable network.

Next, take a look at the left player which shows your source stream, as served
by the Livepeer.com CDN. This player is configured to only playback the highest
resolution available. Except for rare occasions, the highest resolution is the
non-transcoded source stream.

Compare the source in the left player with the transcoded renditions in the
player on the right (ABR). You can manually switch between transcoded renditions
by clicking on the â‹® symbol in the lower right corner of the player.

If the problems in the source-only stream are also present in the transcoded
renditions, there is something wrong with your source stream. If you can,
instruct the streamer to set the keyframe interval to 2 in their broadcasting
software; this can help. In general, make sure your broadcasting workflow is
stable. If the RTMP stream hitting the Livepeer Studio ingest server has problems, try
ensuring a stronger internet connection at the source via a wired ethernet
connection or by broadcasting on a more reliable network.
