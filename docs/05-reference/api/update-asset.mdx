# `PATCH` Update asset

`PATCH /asset/:id -d { }` can be used to modify any `asset` that was uploaded
with On Demand. It is a single endpoint that can update only the following
mutable properties of an asset:

- `name`
- `storage`
- `meta`

## Update Stored Asset

## Updating Asset Name

This will allow the name of the stored asset in Livepeer Studio to be changed.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d { "name": "New name" }
```

## Updating Storage

This allows to add additional storage location of where the assets are to be
stored.

> **NOTE:**

- Currently assets cannot be deleted from the default Livepeer Studio storage.
  You can customize any additional storage though.
- Only IPFS is supported as an additional storage at the moment. We are currently
  working on support for other decentralized storages like Arweave and Storj.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d {"storage": {"ipfs": {}}}
```

## Updating Metadata

This allows for modifying the metadata of the asset, which is customizable NFT.
Since each marketplace has their own standard for the `metadata` of the NFT, it
is up to you to determine which standard to use and fields to include.

> **NOTE:**

- Livepeer Studio's default fields for `metadata` are:

```json
    "name": , //Populated with the asset name
    "description": , //A default description referring to the asset name above
    "image": //A default image including the Livepeer logo as a thumbnail
    "animation_url": //URL for the Livepeer player on IPFS playing the video from Livepeer Studio
    "external_url": //URL for the Livepeer player hosted on lvpr.tv playing the video from Livepeer Studio
    "properties": {
      "video": //CID of the original video file saved on IPFS
      "com.livepeer.playbackId": //playback ID of the asset in Livepeer Studio
    }
```

> **NOTICE** that you can change the value or delete any of these default fields
> by providing a value in the `nftMetadata` field. You can delete any of the
> above fields by specifying them as `null` in your overrides.

Example: `"animation_url": null`

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d {  "meta": {
        "title": "My awesome video",
        "description": "This is a video of my awesome life",
        "tags": "awesome,life,video"
    }
  }
```

## Updating Multiple parameters

This allows for modifying the metadata of the asset, which can be used to
customize the asset of the NFT metadata. These fields are customizable and are
not set.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d {
  "name": "New name",
  "storage": {"ipfs": {}},
  "meta": {
        "title": "My awesome video",
        "description": "This is a video of my awesome life",
        "tags": "awesome,life,video"
    }
  }
```

### Response

Returns a `200 OK` response with an object containing the updated properties
indicates that the `asset` was successfully updated.
