# `PATCH` Update asset

`PATCH /asset/:id -d { }` can be used to modify any `asset` that was uploaded
with On Demand. It is a single endpoint that can update only the following
mutable properties of an asset:

- `name`
- `storage`

## Update Stored Asset

## Updating Asset Name

This will allow the name of the stored asset in Livepeer Studio to be changed.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d { "name": "New name" }
```

## Updating Storage

This allows to add additional storage location of where the assets are to be
stored.

> **NOTE:**

- Currently assets cannot be deleted from the default Livepeer Studio storage.
  You can customize any additional storage though.
- Only IPFS is supported as an additional storage at the moment. We are
  currently working on support for other decentralized storages like Arweave and
  Storj.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d {"storage": {"ipfs": {}}}
```

### Response

Storing a file on IPFS is a long-running operation, which can take a few seconds
to complete. As such, you won't get an immediate result on the response, but
should check the `storage.status` object of the asset (e.g. polling) until it
phases to `ready`. Then you will have the corresponding CIDs of the asset inside
the `storage.ipfs` object.

You can also use the `asset.updated` webhook to get notified when the asset
changes, both for the intermediate progress updates and the final update with
the CIDs added to the object.

## Setting NFT Metadata

When you save a file to IPFS Livepeer Studio also exports a metadata file that
can be used to mint NFTs from the video. This way you don't need to have a
separate IPFS provider only for storing your NFT metadata.

Since each marketplace has their own standard for the `metadata` of the NFT, it
is up to you to determine which standard to use and fields to include.

> **NOTE:**

- Livepeer Studio includes a couple of fields by default which are deep merged
  with the provided NFT metadata, with the provided values having precedence.

```json
    "name": , // Populated with the same name of the asset in the API
    "description": , // A default description referring to the above asset name
    "image": // A default image including the Livepeer logo as a thumbnail
    "animation_url": // IPFS URL for an immutable version of the lvpr.tv player with the video
    "external_url": // Mutable URL for the lvpr.tv player with the video
    "properties": {
      "video": // CID of the original video file saved on IPFS
      "com.livepeer.playbackId": // playback ID of the asset in Livepeer Studio
    }
```

> **NOTICE** that you can change the value or delete any of these default fields
> by providing a value for it in the `nftMetadata` object, which have precedence
> over whatever is set by default. You can delete any of the above fields by
> specifying them as `null` in your overrides.

Example: `"animation_url": null`

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
      "storage": {
        "ipfs": {
          "spec": {
            "nftMetadata": {
              "title": "My awesome video",
              "description": "This is a video of my awesome life",
              "tags": "awesome,life,video"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }'
```

### Response

Same as before, saving the NFT metadata on IPFS will be a long-running
operation. You can track the progress the same way as the simple IPFS request,
with the NFT metadata CID showing up in the `storage.ipfs.nftMetadata` object.

## Updating Multiple parameters

You can also specify multiple fields to update in a single `PATCH` request.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d {
  "name": "New name",
  "storage": {"ipfs": {}}
  }
```

### Response

Returns a `200 OK` response with an object containing the updated properties
indicates that the `asset` was successfully updated.

## Update Access Control Policy

A `playbackPolicy` `type` can be either:
- public - No access control is applied to the asset
- jwt - A JWT is required to playback the asset

If you set your stream or asset's playback policy to jwt, you will need to decode and verify
your stream or asset for playback.

### Request

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{asset_id}' \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
-d {
    "playbackPolicy":{
				"type":"jwt"
   }
}
```

### Response

A `204 No Content` status response indicates the `asset` was successfully updated.
