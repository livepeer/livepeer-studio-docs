# `PATCH` Update signing key

`PATCH /access-control/signing-key/{KEY_ID}` updates an existing `signing key`. 
It is a single endpoint that can update any of the mutable properties of a stream. Specifically:
- `name`
- `disabled`

All fields are optional, and if any field is not included in the request payload
it will be kept unchanged from the saved object.

A `204 No Content` status response indicates the `signing key` was successfully updated.

### Disabling a signing key

```bash
curl https://livepeer.studio/api/access-control/signing-key/${KEY_ID} \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{
    "disabled":true
}'
```

### Changing signing key name

```bash
curl https://livepeer.studio/api/access-control/signing-key/${KEY_ID} \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{
    "name":"My new name for signing key"
}'
```

### Updating all fields

```bash
curl https://livepeer.studio/api/access-control/signing-key/${KEY_ID} \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{
    "disabled":true,
    "name":"My new name for signing key"
}'
```
