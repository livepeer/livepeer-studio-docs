# `DELETE` asset

`DELETE /asset/{ASSET_ID}` deletes an existing `asset` object.

This will delete an existing asset from the Livepeer API database. Deleted
assets can currently be played back from a playback URL, even if the asset is
deleted. There is currently no way to delete an asset from IPFS or "unpin" the
asset through Pinata.

> **NOTE:** If you wish for the asset to be completely removed from our storage,
> please contact us at <help@livepeer.studio>

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{ASSET_ID}' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}'
```
