 - Via [the API](/references), or 
 - Directly interacting with the [Dashboard](https://livepeer.studio/login?next=%2Fdashboard)

## About Livestreaming with Livepeer Studio

Livestreaming is simple with Livepeer Studio. After acquiring an [API Key](../../guides/livestreaming/api-key), you can create livestreams and make calls to the API to get additional information on that stream. This can be done either through the dashboard or by interacting directly with the API.

Once a stream is created, you will receive information for that stream --  for example,  a `Stream ID` for accessing the specific stream, a `Stream Key` and  `RTMP URL` for directing the stream into Livepeer Studio from broadcasting software (e.g., [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)), and a `Playback URL` for viewing in a video player  (e.g.,  [Video.js](https://videojs.com/)).
